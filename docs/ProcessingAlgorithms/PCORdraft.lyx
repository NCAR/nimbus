Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many of the core measurements made from research aircraft are interconnected.
 To measure temperature, corrections must be made for dynamic heating caused
 by the motion of the aircraft; to measure airspeed, measurements of dynamic
 pressure and temperature are needed; corrections are often made to the
 measured pressure that depend on the airspeed and/or orientation of the
 aircraft; accurate measurement of airspeed depends on knowing the humidity
 of the air and so the appropriate gas constants and specific heats; measurement
s of humidity by dew-point sensors must be corrected for differences between
 ambient and sensor pressures; etc.
 There are seldom standards or reliable references for any of these, so
 uncertainty analyses involve complicated and multi-dimensional examinations
 of these interactions and of how flight conditions might influence measurements
 from otherwise carefully calibrated sensors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one could obtain an reliable reference for any of these interlinked measureme
nts, it could be of great value in reducing measurement uncertainty.
 One recent development, a Laser Air Motion Sensor (LAMS), now provides
 such a reference on the National Science Foundation / National Center for
 Atmospheric Research (NSF/NCAR) Gulfstream V and C-130 research aircraft
 (hereafter referred to as the GV and C-130).
 This study explores how those measurements can be used to reduce key measuremen
t uncertainties for measurements made on those aircraft.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operating principles of the LAMS and the measurements it provides are
 discussed in the next section.
 The absolute measurement of airspeed that the LAMS provides makes it possible
 to deduce the expected dynamic pressure (or the pressure increase above
 ambient or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

static
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pressure that occurs when air is brought to a stagnation point in flight)
 with improved accuracy.
 It will be argued that this measured correction to the dynamic pressure
 can then be used to improve measurements of the static pressure.
 Once pressure is known with high accuracy, temperature differences can
 be determined during altitude changes by integration of the hydrostatic
 pressure between flight levels because the pressure and geometric altitude
 of the bounding flight levels are then known with improved accuracy, the
 pressure from the newly calibrated static pressure measurements and the
 altitude from the high accuracy global positioning system (GPS) measurements
 now available.
 Finally, it is shown that the LAMS can provide a measurement of temperature
 that is independent of normal temperature sensors.
 Furthermore, this measurement should be valid during cloud penetrations
 as well as in clear air.
 The conclusions of the paper then will summarize how this analysis has
 reduced measurement uncertainty for key state-parameter measurements from
 these research aircraft.

\begin_layout Section
The NCAR Laser Air Motion Sensing System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The laser air motion sensor (LAMS) used in this study is that described
 by Spuler et al.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(2011).
 It is a single-beam system in which a laser is focused ahead of the aircraft
 in undisturbed air so that, from the Doppler shift in laser light returned
 from aerosols, the airspeed can be measured outside the disturbed airflow
 caused by the aircraft.
 For the study presented here, the focus was about 12 m ahead of the wing
 pod on which the sensor was mounted, or about xx m ahead of the nose of
 the (swept-wing) aircraft.
 At this distance, the returned signal arises primarily from a volume extending
 about 1 m along the direction of flight, as given by the full-width-half-maximu
m distance of the telescope gain pattern.
 The beam was directed approximately 3
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 downward relative to the aircraft center line because the aircraft typically
 flies with approximately this angle of attack.
 (Pitot-tube sensors to be discussed in this paper are similarly offset
 to compensate for the normal angle of attack.) A small inertial system mounted
 in the wing pod measured any possible deviation in direction caused by
 wing flex or other vibration of the pod relative to the aircraft center
 axis, and near that center axis there was also an inertial reference system
 that measured the aircraft attitude angles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sensor is based on detection of the Doppler-shifted signal backscattered
 from aerosol particles in the atmosphere.
 The wavelength used is 1.56 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m, so there must be aerosol particles with sizes approximately this large
 to produce a signal.
 Spuler et al.
 (2011) estimated that about 2 cm
\begin_inset Formula $^{-3}$
\end_inset

 particles with diameter in the range from 0.1-3 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m were needed to provide a detectable signal.
 Successful detection of the backscattered signal has been possible at altitudes
 extending to above 13 km, although with present sensitivity there are times
 when the signal is lost during flight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The precision estimated in Spuler et al.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(2011) is <0.05 m/s for 1-s samples (as will be used in the present analyses),
 although the system can provide data at much higher rates because individual
 samples are recorded at 100 Hz after averaging of individual spectra sampled
 at rates of about 200 kHz.
 Because the conversion from Doppler frequency to airspeed involves only
 the wavelength of the laser which is known with high accuracy (1.5600 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m), the conversion from Doppler frequency shift to airspeed can be regarded
 as an exact relationship compared to other errors.
 The peak Doppler frequency can be measured to an accuracy that, converted
 to airspeed, is better than 0.1 m/s.
 The precision estimate from Spuler et al.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(2011) also supports an accuracy estimate in this range if there is no bias
 in the selection of the peak in the shifted frequency spectrum, as is supported
 by careful examination of the recorded spectra and the operation of the
 algorithm that identifies the peak.

 When the signal-to-noise ratio indicates that there is inadequate signal
 from which to obtain a Doppler shift, the measurements are flagged as missing
 and are not used in the analysis to follow.

\begin_layout Section
Calibrating the Pressure Sensing System

\begin_layout Subsection
Dynamic Pressure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most straightforward application of measurements from the LAMS is to
 predict the dynamic pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the static pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{p}$
\end_inset

 the respective specific heats of air at constant volume or constant pressure,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{a}$
\end_inset

the gas constant for air, the Mach number 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 (ratio of flight speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 to the speed of sound 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\gamma R_{a}T}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=c_{p}/c_{v}$
\end_inset

) is given by the following equation, which arises from conservation of
 energy and depends only on the gas behaving approximately as a perfect
 gas [give reference]:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M=\left\{ \left(\frac{2c_{v}}{R_{a}}\right)\left[\left(\frac{p+q}{\mathrm{p}}\right)^{R_{a}/c_{p}}-1\right]\right\} ^{1/2}\,\,.\label{eq:MachEq-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving for the dynamic pressure gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q=p\left\{ \left(\frac{v^{2}}{2c_{p}T}+1\right)^{c_{P}/R_{a}}-1\right\} \label{eq:qFromLAMS-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which shows that, with knowledge of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, LAMS (measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

) can provide an independent measurement of the dynamic pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, small errors in 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 will have a small effect on the deduced dynamic pressure because expected
 errors are a small fraction of the total static pressure or the absolute
 temperature.

Corrections are usually applied to measurements of dynamic pressure on research
 aircraft, including the NSF/NCAR research aircraft, so comparing 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 as provided by (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:qFromLAMS-1"

\end_inset

) to the direct measurement of dynamic pressure is an exaggeration of the
 improvement that LAMS provides.
 Nevertheless, Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:QvsQLAMS"

\end_inset

 shows that the difference between the predicted value from LAMS using (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:qFromLAMS-1"

\end_inset

) and the direct measurement (from one of the pitot tubes on the C-130 reference
d to the static pressure source) is substantial and exhibits both a large
 bias and significant scatter.
 Applying corrections to the direct measurement is therefore important if
 the air motion relative to the aircraft is to be determined accurately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Static Pressure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The normal measurement of total pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}=p+q$
\end_inset

 is obtained on the GV and most research aircraft by measuring the pressure
 delivered by a pitot tube aligned approximately along the airflow.
 On the GV, this measurement is made by adding two measurements, that of
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 (measured by a Parascientific Model 1000 absolute pressure transducer with
 accuracy 0.1 mb, connected to static ports on the fuselage of the aircraft)
 and that of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 (meadured by a Mensor Model 6100 differential sensor with accuracy 0.02
 mb, connected between the static ports and the pressure delivered by a
 pitot tube).
 Pitot tubes are generally insensitive to small deviations from normal flow
 angles, typically delivering accurate total pressure within about 0.1% for
 flow angles several degrees from the centerline of the pitot tube (cite
 reference).
 However, static ports can deliver pressures that depart much more from
 the true ambient pressure at the flight level when flow around the fuselage
 varies, and they can also produce biases even at normal flight angles,
 so the largest error is expected in 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and consequently in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 while their sum 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 has a substantially smaller error.
 This was checked on the GV and on the C-130 by comparing redundant sources
 for these measurements.
 For example, on the NSF/NCAR C-130, there are two independent sets of static
 ports and pitot tubes, and on the GV there are also redundant sensors as
 part of the avionics package for the aircraft.
 Comparisons examining these independent pairs showed that the results for
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 were remarkably consistent among all pairs (agreeing to within 0.1 hPa)
 but there was significant variability in the redundant measurements of
 both 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, often at the few-hPa level.

 compares the redundant measurements of total pressure on the C-130, each
 based on a different pitot source and static source.
 This and other similar comparisons suggest that a good approximation is
 to consider 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 accurately measured and to assume that the error in the measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta q$
\end_inset

), is equal to the negative of the error in the measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{m}$

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

) because both arise from the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result, the correction to dynamic pressure obtained from LAMS also
 provides a correction to static pressure, and these can be applied simultaneous

which gives the correction to static pressure in terms of the measurements
 of static and dynamic pressure, the airspeed measured by the LAMS, and
 the absolute temperature.
 The negative sign arises because the correction needed is the negative
 of the measurement error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The temperature is needed to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

, but it can be assumed tentatively that the accuracy of the temperature
 measurement is adequate for this analysis.
 Once pressure corrections are found, the accuracy of this assumption can
 be checked and the process can be iterated as necessary.

\begin_layout Standard
Equations (

\begin_layout Subsection
Some Necessary Refinements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of these analyses is to determine characteristics like pressure
 significantly more accurately than has been possible in the past, so this
 objective requires attention to some minor error sources.
 Specifically, it was necessary to consider: (i) the humidity of the air
 and its effect on thermodynamic properties like the gas constant and specific
 heats; (ii) possible effects of flow angles on the total pressure measured
 by the pitot tube; and (iii) the effect of small departures of the pointing
 angle of the LAMS beam from the direction of the relative wind.

Effects of humidity.

 The first was determined in a straightforward way by considering the properties

(ii.) Effect of flow not parallel to the pitot tube.

\bar default
 According to information provided by manufacturers, the typical sensitivity
 of a pitot tube to flow direction is less than 1% at flow angles up to
 10
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 and less than 0.2% for flow angles up to 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 The error is in the direction of measuring too low a total pressure as
 the flow angle increases, and to some extent it is compensated by orientation
 of the pitot tubes along the angle-of-attack flow angle expected in normal
 flight.
 To verify that the pitot-tube measurements are insensitive to the small
 flow angles expected in normal flight, an analysis is presented in Appendix
 B based on yaw maneuvers flown with the LAMS.
 The analysis supports the insensitivity of the total-pressure measurement
 to flow angles at angles from 0-3
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

, as is characteristic of most flight conditions on the RAF aircraft.

can this be tested vs AOA using measurements? a) LAMS gives predicted value
 along longitudinal axis; after correction, gives magnitude of relative
 wind and so predicted value for q.
 If LAMS is used directly for the correction (i.e., not the fit, which includes
 an AOA dependence), a plot of mean correction factor vs AOA should characterize
 this dependence.
 Use maneuvers for this to minimize effect of other factors like Mach No?
 Alas, no, because maneuver probably affects static defect so there will
 be an effect on predicted vs measured q arising from that, and that can't
 be separated from an effect on AOA.
 Still, if no mean dependence is found, that would argue for validity of
 both (and lack of dependence on attach or sideslip in fits for PCORS argues
 for this.
 Worth a look, if regions are controlled for Mach No and q which are shown
 significant dependences in the fits.
 Use GV, where there is no dependence found on adifr and bdifr.

(iii).
 Effects of LAMS orientation.

\bar default
 Because there was an inertial reference system mounted on the same under-wing
 pylon that carried the LAMS, it was possible to correct for small departures
 in pointing angle relative to the aircraft reference line, the orientation
 of which was also measured by a separate inertial reference system.
 In addition, a correction is needed if the airflow angle is not along the
 centerline of the pitot tube, as when the angle of attack differs from
 that represented by the orientation of the pitot tube.
 Under these conditions, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the pitot tube is relatively insensitive to flow angles and so
 measures the total dynamic pressure, as argued above and in Appendix B,
 LAMS measures the relative wind in a specific direction.
 For LAMS, the effect of a flow angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 relative to the beam is that it measures 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{l}=v\,\cos(\theta)$
\end_inset

.
 The beam is oriented close to but slightly offset from the longitudinal
 axis of the aircraft, at viewing angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$
\end_inset

 above and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}$
\end_inset

 to the starboard side of the longitudinal axis.
 Then, with sideslip

 positive for relative wind approaching from the starboard side of the aircraft,

When the LAMS is operating, the corrections to static and dynamic pressure
 can be determined directly from (

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 than empirical corrections used previously (often determined by reference
 to data obtained by 'trailing-cone' sensors, tubes that trailed behind
 the aircraft and were designed to provide a static pressure reference carried
 outside the influence of the aircraft).
 The LAMS evaluation (Spuler et al, 20xx) suggests that the uncertainty
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $v$

 is about 0.1 m/s, so this is directly the uncertainty in the component of
 the relative wind along the axis of LAMS.

\end{equation}

\end_inset

This shows that the temperature uncertainty contributes significantly to
 the uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $q,$
\end_inset

 often more than the uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 from LAMS, because 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta v/v\approx0.1/220\approx0.000$

\end_inset

C contributes typically a similar fractional contribution of 0.5*0.3/223
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$
\end_inset

0.0005 for typical flight conditions for the GV.
 To obtain this level of uncertainty in temperature, a prerequisite is to
 use the airspeed from LAMS directly in the correction for dynamic heating,
 because otherwise the analysis is inconsistent.
 That is, the temperature should be determined directly from

\begin_layout Standard
Interpreted as an uncertainty in dynamic pressure q, the uncertainty in
 the prediction of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 from LAMS determined from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) is typically about 0.13 hPa (for flight at 125 m/s where the pressure is
 760 mb and the temperature 0
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

C).
 Other indications are that the uncertainty in total pressure measurement
 is also about 0.1 hPa, so using the LAMS correction yields a correction
 to the ambient pressure that has an uncertainty of around 0.15 hPa.
 Another case more representative of higher-level flight of the GV is flight
 at a pressure level of 150 mb, with temperature -60
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

C, at an airspeed of about 235 m/s; this leads to an uncertainty in total
 pressure measurement after correction via LAMS of about 0.15 hPa also.
 When LAMS is present, it is thus possible to be confident that the measurements
 of the longitudinal component of the relative wind and of the static pressure
 have associated uncertainties of only about 0.1 m/s and 0.15 hPa, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is still value is determining fits to the corrections provided by
 LAMS in terms of flight characteristics like flight level, angle of attack,
 Mach number, etc., because then corrections can be applied in cases where
 the LAMS is not present or does not detect enough signal to provide a valid
 airspeed.
 Such fits can be applied retrospectively to data collected before the LAMS
 was available, and the fits can also be compared to other means of estimating
 the corrections.
 A further reason for developing fits is that the LAMS measurement, being
 offset from the nose of the aircraft, can sense fluctuations from the condition
s present at the nose, and averaging over such fluctuations as provided
 by functional fits smooths the predicted corrections.
 For these reasons, fits to the measurements provided by (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PCOR2-1"

\end_inset

) were explored until adequate representations of the predicted fits were
 found.
 Dependent variables in the fits included static pressure, dynamic pressure,
 Mach number, angle of attack, sideslip, airspeed, and other characteristics
 of flight.
 The measurements from a flight during which the LAMS provided useful measuremen
ts almost continuously and during which there were many altitude changes
 and speed variations (flown for this purpose) were used.

\end_layout

\end_inset

, where the quoted significant digits reflect the standard error in determining
 these coefficients.
 In the analysis of significance for the fit, all these coefficients were
 significant as being needed to represent the variance, at significance
 levels less than 0.001.
 The correlation coefficient between the measured pressure corrections and
 those predicted by (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PCORforGV"

\end_inset

) was 0.98 and the standard error was 0.00089 (i.e., 0.089% of the measured pressure,
 or about 0.3 hPa at a typical ambient pressure of 
\begin_inset Formula $p=350$
\end_inset

 hPa).
 This standard error reflects individual measurements, for which some scatter
 arises because the LAMS and pressure-sensing systems detect air parcels
 slightly displaced from each other and so potentially having different
 air motions.
 Because the fit determining the coefficients in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PCORforGV"

\end_inset

) is based on >10,000 measurements each characterizing 1 s, but with correlation
s among the measurements likely extending over 10-100 s, one would expect
 the uncertainty in predictions from the fit to be at least 10--30 times
 smaller than the standard error, or typically less than 0.03 hPa.
 The high correlation coefficient indicates that the fit accounts for >96%
 of the variance between the predicted and measured pressure corrections,
 with the remaining variance likely arising from real variance between sampled
 parcels because including additional functional dependence terms in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PCORforGV"

\end_inset

) did not reduce the residual variance beyond this limit.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The range of ADIFR/QCR used here was (-0.2, -0.03) and the fit extrapolates
 poorly beyond that range, apparently introducing significant errors at
 larger values, so this correction should be limited to this range and not
 applied to the highest cases of AOA.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LAMS measurements indicate that the mean correction required to the
 ambient pressure, for this set of flight conditions, is 3.5 hPa and the
 standard deviation in that correction is 1.45 hPa.
 If (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PCORforGV"

\end_inset

) accounts for 96% of that variance, the remaining variance is equivalent
 to a residual standard deviation of <0.3 hPa.
 Because most of that variance arises from turbulent regions where the volumes
 sampled by the LAMS and the pressure-sensing system can be moving differently,
 this can be interpreted as an upper limit to the uncertainty in the pressure
 correction.
 Thus using the LAMS measurement of airspeed has removed a 3.5 hPa error
 and reduced the residual uncertainty (from this source alone) to <0.3 hPa.

 Some part of this scatter likely results from variance in the LAMS measurement,

 the pitot tube, but more likely indicating some resolution problem in determini
ng the LAMS prediction because the variance spectrum showed some indication
 of resolution noise at 1 Hz.

 did not improve significatly with higher powers of QCF/PSF or of

 However, the cubic polynomial in Mach number was required; omitting any
 of the terms in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 increase in the standard error of the fit.

 the variance in

 This formula with these coefficients thus appears to be a good representation

A concern regarding (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:PCORforGV"

\end_inset

) is that, during the flight from which this fit was determined, the variable
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p_{\alpha}/\Delta q_{r}$
\end_inset

 varied only from about -0.2 to -0.03, while the full flight envelope of the
 GV spans a larger range.
 There is a danger that the cubic dependence on this term might extrapolate
 to erroneous corrections outside that range, so other fits less sensitive
 to extrapolation errors were developed that, although slightly less accurate,
 should extrapolate to new conditions better.
 One good example was the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta p}{p}=a_{0}+a_{1}\frac{q_{m}}{p_{m}}+a_{2}M^{2}+a_{3}\frac{\Delta p_{\alpha}}{\Delta q_{r}}\label{eq:PCOR_GV_simple}

The second term gave the largest reduction in residual error; using this
 variation alone gave a residual standard error of 0.00050.
 The least significant was the last term, only reducing the residual standard
 error by 0.000013 for a typical effect on pressure of 0.01 mb, so this term
 will be dropped even though the fit indicated that it was a significant
 contributor.
 Forcing 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{5}=0$

 also had an insignificant effect on the result because the dependence on
 this term is already represented well by the Mach number variation.

}={0.001628887, 0.021428833, 0.014524779} and all others zero gave a residual
 standard error of 0.00044 and so an additional error contribution to the
 corrected pressure of typically 0.014 hPa, which is insignificant in comparison
 to other expected error sources, so the recommended coefficients (with
 consideration the standard errors in the determination of the coefficients
 in specifying the precision of the values) are {
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2}$
\end_inset

}={0.00163, 0.0214, 0.0145} with all other coefficients set to zero.
 While the residuals from this fit are small, the mean offset it produces
 is about 2 hPa, so (as illustrated by Fig.\SpecialChar \-

Comparisons to Other Evidence

There are several comparisons possible that can test these results.
 Three are discussed in this section:

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Wind measurements in reverse-heading maneuvers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A reverse-heading maneuver is one in which a straight-and-level flight leg
 is flown for a short time (2-5 min) and then the aircraft reverses course
 and flies the same leg in the opposite direction.
 Usually, these are flown approximately along and against the wind direction.
 A test of the accuracy of the measurement of dynamic pressure is that the
 longitudinal component of the wind should not change in reverse-heading
 maneuvers in which the aircraft is flown over the same (drifting) flight
 leg twice with opposite headings.
 To isolate the effect of the measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and hence true airspeed, the best wind component to use is that along the
 axis of the aircraft, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{g}\cos\beta-\mathrm{TAS}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{g}$
\end_inset

 is the groundspeed of the aircraft and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the angle between the groundspeed vector and the heading of the aircraft.

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Phi-\Psi$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 is the heading of the aircraft.
 Then the wind component along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{long}=v_{g}\cos(\Phi-\Psi)-v_{t}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{t}$
\end_inset

is the true airspeed provided either directly from LAMS or from the corrected
 dynamic pressure via (

\end_inset

) for the GV or (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PCORfitQCF-1"

\end_inset

) for the C-130.
 The expectation is then that the longitudinal component of the wind will
 reverse sign between the two legs of the reverse-heading maneuver.
 Within statistics imposed by atmospheric fluctuations, this is then a test
 of the validity of the longitudinal component of the wind measurements.

 the excluded legs would be more than two standard deviations from the mean.
 Excluding these two legs gives 10 legs with a mean difference of -0.26

 This result suggests that the error in measurement of longitudinal wind
 is -0.13

m/s, which is consistent with estimates of the uncertainty associated with
 the LAMS measurements of airspeed on which these corrections are based,
 so this provides strong evidence that the uncertainty in the measurement
 of the longitudinal component of the relative wind after correction is
 about 0.1 m/s (standard error).

The GV avionics pressure system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The static pressure measurement of the avionics system on the GV is more
 reliable than those on many research aircraft because the GV is certified
 to fly on RVSM (reduced vertical separation minimum) levels so must meet
 strict FAA-imposed requirements.
 Appendix G to FAR Part 91 specifies that the maximum allowable error in
 altitude is 80 ft, or about 24 m.
 In the RSVM altitude range (flight levels 290 to 410), this corresponds
 to a requirement that the error in pressure be in the range from about
 0.68 hPa (near FL410) to 1.1 hPa (near FL290).
 For the GV flight used above, the mean difference between the pressure
 provided by the avionic system and that measured with correction by LAMS,
 for the RVSM altitude range, was +0.36 hPa with standard deviation 0.19 hPa,
 so within the tolerance required by RVSM standards the avionics pressure
 is consistent with the measured pressure as calibrated in this study.

 system, a segment of pipe with pressure ports on the sides that is held
 in a horizontal orientation by the drag of a cone trailed behind the aircraft.
 The pressure ports were connected via a long tube to a differential pressure
 sensor that measured the difference relative to the research pressure ports
 on the aircraft (which, for certification reasons, remain separate from
 the static sources that supply the avionics system).
 The flight was long because it extended from Colorado over the Gulf of
 Mexico in order to collect low-level measurements.
 Flight segments were flown at various airspeeds spanning the available
 range of airspeeds at altitudes from near sea level to FL490 (49,000 ft
 pressure altitude, or about 14.9 km pressure altitude).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the measurements from the trailing cone are considered reference values,
 the measured difference is then a correction to be applied to the measured

The dominant variation of the pressure correction represented in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) is that on Mach number, so testing that dependence is a useful constraint
 on the validity of the corrections.
 Repeatedly during the flight used to determine the pressire calibration
 in this study, the GV was flown in level flight moving from near its low-speed
 limit to near its high-speed limit.
 If the pressure corrections are adequate, such maneuvers should not introduce
 perturbations into the measured pressure fields.
 A stringent test of this expected independence of Mach number is to consider
 the difference between the geometric altitude and the pressure altitude
 (or

 This compensates for small altitude changes of the aircraft and should
 show a continuous change not perturbed by the airspeed changes.

When the aircraft, at about 450 hPa flight altitude, was slowed to its minimum

 0.73, as shown in Fig.

.
 However, the during flight segments at steady speed the various measurements
 of d-value are consistent to within about 3 m, a change in d-value correspondin
g to a pressure change of only about 0.2 hPa.
 In the higher Mach-number range of the flight envelope, deviations were
 still smaller, consistent with linear change with time to within about
 0.1 hPa.
 This is an indication that the larger deviations of the fit from the LAMS-measu
red values occur at the extremes of the flight envelope, and that errors
 in the corrections represented by (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) are reduced if the aircraft remains close to its normal flight envelope
 in unaccelerated flight.
 However, the consistency of the trend suggests that the dependence of the
 correction on Mach number is appropriate to within an uncertainty of about
 0.2 hPa.

\begin_layout Section
Checking the Calibrations of Thermometers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With accurate measurements of both pressure and geometric altitude, it is
 possible to test calibrations of the temperature sensors on the research
 aircraft by calculating height differences from integration of the hydrostatic
 equation and comparing to measured height differences.
 The latter are provided with high accuracy by modern Global Positioning
 System (GPS) measurements of geometric altitude.
 The improved accuracy in the measurement of pressure provided by LAMS reduces
 the uncertainty in the measurement of pressure differences and enables
 a more stringent test of the validity of the measurements of temperature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hydrostatic equation can be expressed in this form: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta p_{i}=-\frac{g\, p_{i}}{R_{a}T_{a,i}}\delta z_{i}\label{eq:hydrostaticEq-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where {
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i},T_{a,i}$
\end_inset

} are the values of air pressure and temperature for the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th measurement and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta p_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the change in pressure for the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th step, during which the geometric altitude changes by 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta z_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This equation can be rearranged to obtain an estimate of the temperature:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{a,i}=-\frac{g\,}{R_{a}}\frac{\delta z_{i}}{\delta\ln p_{i}}\label{eq:Tfromdzdp-1}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measurement uncertainty of 0.1% in derived temperature (i.e., a typical uncertainty
 of 0.3
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C) requires at least 0.1% accuracy in the measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta z$
\end_inset

, an accuracy readily obtained by differential GPS over intervals as small
 as 10 m.
 The requirement is more stringent on the measurement of pressure.
 In 1 s at 10 m/s climb, the pressure change is less than 1 hPa, and it
 seems likely that differences in pressure cannot be measured confidently
 to better than 0.1 mb, so this would introduce an error of 10% in the deduced
 (absolute) temperature.
 This is inadequate, so larger differences (or the average of many measurements)
 are required to obtain a useful estimate of the temperature.

 during one test flight of the C-130 was devoted to repeated climbs and

 ft, or over a pressure range of about 100 hPa.

 uncertainty of 0.1% or, in absolute temperature, an uncertainty of about
 0.3

C in the mean temperature between the layers.
 It should therefore be possible to test the temperature measurements with
 about this level of confidence.

For the record: I did try to fit a linear correction using the measurements
 of RF08, IDEAS-4.
 A least-squares minimization procedure was used: Find the values of

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 that minimize the variance 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \chi^{2}=\sum_{i}}\left(T_{m,i}+c_{0}+c_{1}T_{m,i}-T_{a,i}\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the 1-s values were so variable that the attempt to calculate
 fit coefficients led to a singular inversion, which presumably arose from
 the large numbers entering the fit.
 It may be possible to return to this, but the preceding evidence suggested
 that the temperature measurements are approximately within expected errors
 so I didn't pursue this for the C-130.

A similar approach can be taken for the GV, with promise of a larger range

 However, because of the existence of many flights with frequent altitude

 (e.g., from HIPPO)
\end_layout

\end_inset

, it was decided to take a different approach in an attempt to determine
 a polynomial-fit correction to the temperature via minimization of the
 error between actual altitude changes and those predicted from integration
 of the hydrostatic equation.
 The procedure used was as follows:
\end_layout

 to ALTC), TASX (for validation that the aircraft is above flight speeds
 where the flaps might be extended), and a total temperature measurement
 like TTHR1.
 Include also DVALUE measurements, for information on the horizontal pressure
 gradient as explained below.

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(T_{t})=T_{t}+a_{0}+a_{1}T_{t}+a_{2}T_{t}^{2}+...
\]

\end_inset

The vertical integration will match the pressure change only if the atmosphere
 is horizontally homogeneous.
 If not, the results will be biased as the fit attempts to compensate for
 horizontal gradients.
 This can introduce a serious error into the minimization results.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To consider how serious this problem is, it is useful to assess how a pressure
 gradient will affect the results.
 Suppose the pressure gradient along the flight path is 
\begin_inset Formula $dp/ds=G_{p}$
\end_inset

 .
 Then there will be a contribution to the pressure change over a period
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T$
\end_inset

 not associated with an altitude change, of magnitude 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{p}V\Delta T$
\end_inset

, arising just from the pressure gradient, so in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AltitudeChangeEquation-1"

\end_inset

) the pressure ratio must be modified to be 
\begin_inset Formula $(p_{i}-G_{p}V)/p_{i-1}$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Fortunately, there is a way to measure the horizontal pressure gradient
 because it will be reflected in the change in DVALUE.
 For example, in level flight the change in DVALUE will measure the pressure
 gradient; similarly, in a climb, the change in DVALUE can be compared to
 that expected for the measured temperature vs that of a standard atmosphere,
 so that also can be used as a measure of the pressure gradient.
 For horizontal or nearly horizontal motion (e.g., along pressure surfaces),
 
\begin_inset Formula $(dp/ds=-\rho g\, dH_{p}/ds$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the height at pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 The change 
\begin_inset Formula $dH_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the same as the change in DVALUE.
 The term needed to correct the pressure used in the hydrostatic equation
 is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{p}V\Delta T=-\rho gV\Delta T(dH_{p}/ds)=-\rho g\Delta H_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 In a climb, however, the same correction is not possible because a change
 caused by a horizontal pressure gradient can't be distinguished from one
 caused by a different temperature along the flight path.
 Even at 40,000 ft, though, the GV climbs at above 5 m/s, so the ratio of
 contributions from the horizontal and vertical gradients will be
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{-\rho g\Delta H_{p}}{-\rho g\Delta z}=\frac{V(dH_{p}/ds)}{W}\simeq40\frac{dH_{p}}{ds}
\]

\end_inset

For example, an upper limit to the horizontal height gradient might be 10
 m/100 km or <10
\begin_inset Formula $^{-4}$
\end_inset

; most level flight segments in the HIPPO flights show less than this gradient.
 In this case the vertical gradient would be changed by about 0.004, and
 a temperature change of around 1
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C would be required to produce the same change in the gradient.
 At this level of effect, it seems reasonable to expect that the measurements
 will tend to average toward the correct answer, especially if repeated
 climbs and descents are flown in the same direction so that the effects
 of the horizontal pressure gradient on climbs and descents tend to cancel.
 However, if all points including those from level legs are included, the
 trend that will be present in the horizontal gradient for flights that
 do not return to the starting base can easily be large enough to bias the
 deduced temperature by 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$
\end_inset

 or so.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There are several steps that can be taken to compensate for the horizontal
 pressure gradient:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Use only periods when the climb rate exceeds some threshold (e.g., 2 m/s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use DVALUE measurements from level flight segments to estimate the gradient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use a comparison between pressure measured during climb and descent to estimate
 and remove the gradient.
 For example, it would be possible to determine the height of fixed pressure
 surfaces on climb and again on descent, then use the difference as an estimate
 of the pressure gradient between those locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use the whole-flight average DVALUE (perhaps only from level legs) to determine
 the pressure gradient, and apply a correction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use only flights not returning to the takeoff point, to avoid cases where
 it is not straightforward to determine the gradient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategy that will be tried first is the following: Require fabsf(VSPD)>2.0
 or some other tolerance.
 If the results seem adequate and consistent, stop; otherwise, on each climb
 store values of ALTV at fixed pressures separated by 50 mb, and store the
 locations (lat/long).
 Make a 2nd pass that uses the stored values to determine the pressure gradients
 as a function of time through the flight and adds these to the data files.
 Then use those horizontal pressure gradients to correct the values entering

As discussed above, the LAMS provides a direct measurement of the longitudinal
 component of the relative wind, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{L}$

 Those two pressures are sufficient to determine the Mach number, the ratio

 to the speed of sound 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{S}=\sqrt{\gamma R_{a}T}$

One common assumption about the origin of these errors is that the total
 pressure at the tip of a pitot tube is correct, but that errors in both
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$
\end_inset

 arise from errors in the pressure present at the static ports.
 If that is the case, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta q=-\Delta p$

, so

The variables PSXC and QCXC then represent values of the static and dynamic
 pressure that are corrected by estimates of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta q$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 Note that, with this assumption and using 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$

 to denote the pressure at the tip of the pitot tube,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
so 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 would be measured correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Redundant measurements provide a test of this assumption because they should
 provide the same total pressure.
 There are two sets of measurements of static and dynamic pressure on the
 C-130, (PSFD/QCF) and (PSFRD/QCFR), so if both provide accurate measurement
 of the total pressure then PSFD+QCF should equal PSFRD+QCFR.
 The figure below shows that this is valid to high accuracy: The best fit
 to the measurements is (PSFRD+QCFR)=
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

(PSFD+QCF)+0.10 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1.0000$
\end_inset

, and the RMS deviation from this best-fit line is 0.04 mb.
 However, the total pressures differ on average by almost 3 mb and a best
 fit shows more scatter (about 0.6 mb).
 This is supporting evidence for the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 is measured correctly and that the errors in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$
\end_inset

 arise from errors in the pressure provided by the static buttons.

New representations of these corrections can be found from the LAMS.
 Because that provides an absolute measurement, it should be more reliable
 than other calibration sources.
 If the LAMS measurements of relative wind give consistent parameterizations
 in terms of other variables, those parameterizations can be used when the
 LAMS is not present, but when present it may be preferable to use the LAMS
 determination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$

 directly in processing.
 The next section analyzes this possibility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The absolute accuracy of the measurements from LAMS suggests that it may
 be possible to calibrate several other measurements by using LAMS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
LAMS determines TAS directly and so is a check on alternate calculations
 of TAS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Equivalently, LAMS can be used to determine dynamic pressure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Because the error in measured dynamic pressure is probably a result of erroneous
 static pressure, LAMS, by determining this error, can determine an accurate
 value of static pressure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
LAMS can be used in this way to provide a reference from which to determine
 parameterizations for the errors in static and dynamic pressure, for use
 when the LAMS is not present or not operational.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Because LAMS determines airspeed, it can be used with measurements of static
 and dynamic pressure to determine the temperature, 
\emph on
independent of any temperature sensor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This measurement of temperature will be valid in cloud and rain, so valid
 measurements of in-cloud temperature will be possible.
 LAMS operates well in cloud unless the windows become covered with ice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Improved accuracy in the measurement of pressure makes it possible, with
 accurate differential GPS, to integrate the hydrostatic equation and use
 the difference in height between to levels to determine the mean temperature
 in the interval between those levels, thus checking or calibrating the
 temperature measurement from either LAMS or the immersion sensors.

There are general studies of pitot tubes that suggest their typical sensitivity

\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, 0.2% up to 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 They are oriented so that they face the mean flow, so normal departures
 from the mean flow angle during flight are usually much smaller than this.
 It is critical to the analysis approach taken here that the measured total
 pressure be accurate, so some test of this assumption is useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the C-130, there are redundant sensor pairs that sense the dynamic pressure
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and the static pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 The total pressure is measured by adding two sets of sensors, either PSFD
 and QCF or PSFRD and QCRF.
 The total pressure is measured as PSFD+QCF or PSFRD+QCRF, where the two
 sets use independent static ports and independent pitot-tube sources.
 Comparing these provides a test of the assumption that the total pressure
 is delivered accurately by the pitot tubes and is measured accurately by
 the transducers, because, even if the two measurements of static pressure
 differ (as they do) because of their different sensing positions on the
 aircraft, the sums should be the same.
 The following figure shows a comparison of the two independent measurements
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 on the C-130:

A fit to these measurements gave PSFRD+QCFR=
\begin_inset Formula $a_{o}+a_{1}$
\end_inset

(PSFD+QFC) with 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=-0.065$
\end_inset

 mb and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}=1.0003$
\end_inset

, with an RMS scatter about this fit of 0.04 mb.
 The mean difference between these two independent measurements was 0.15
 mb.
 In contrast, the averages of the individual components (
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

) entering the measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 differed by about 2.5 mb.
 This provides support for the assumption that the unertainty in total pressure
 is much smaller than that in the uncorrected measurements of either static
 or dynamic pressure, so it appears reasonable to assume that the errors
 in measurements of the latter arise from errors in the pressure delivered
 by the static ports.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the GV, there is only one set of sensors in the NCAR/RAF-provided data
 system, but there are pressure measurements available from the avionics
 package also that can be used in the same way.
 In this case, the total pressure measured by the avionic-system pair of
 measurements is about 1.1 mb higher than the corresponding measurements
 from the GV RAF data system, and the best fit is PS_A+QC_A=1.2 mb + 0.9996(PSF+QC
F), with an RMS error from this fit of 0.2 mb.
 This error arises partly from filtering applied to the avionics-system
 measurements, which is evident in spectral characteristics of those measurement
s and leads to obvious differences in cases where measured quantities are
 changing rapidly.
 Nevertheless, this comparison is better than the comparison of either static
 or dynamic pressure alone and so provides some evidence that the measurement
 of total pressure is more accurate than those measurements.
 Therefore, in the following, it will be assumed that the total pressure
 is measured accurately, and corrections will be developed to adjust 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 to be that required by the measurements from LAMS.

 0.002393596}.
 The RMS error for this fit was 0.00042, corresponding to a pressure uncertainty
 at 700 hPa of about 0.3 hPa for the individual measurements.

The data constrained the mean of the function to more than a factor of 100

The second term gave the largest reduction in residual error; using this
 variation alone gave a residual standard error of 0.00050.
 The least significant was the last term, only reducing the residual standard
 error by 0.000013 for a typical effect on pressure of 0.01 mb, so this term
 will be dropped even though the fit indicated that it was a significant
 contributor.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{5}=0$
\end_inset

 also had an insignificant effect on the result because the dependence on
 this term is already represented well by the Mach number variation.
 An adequate and simpler fit with only coefficients {
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2}$
\end_inset

}={0.001628887, 0.021428833, 0.014524779} and all others zero gave a residual
 standard error of 0.00044 and so an additional error contribution to the
 corrected pressure of typically 0.014 mb, which is insignificant in comparison
 to other expected error sources, so the recommended coefficients (with
 consideration the standard errors in the determination of the coefficients
 in specifying the precision of the values) are {
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2}$
\end_inset

}={0.00163, 0.0214, 0.0145} with all other coefficients set to zero.
 While the residuals from this fit are small, the mean offset it produces
 is about 2 mb.

Another, perhaps preferable, approach is to determine sensitivity to angle
 of attack and sideslip from periods when there are maneuvers, fix these,
 and then determine any additional variability from fits to entire flights.
 IDEAS RF05 had two periods with sideslip maneuvers and two with pitch maneuvers
; for former suggested that sensitivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p/\mathrm{PSFD}$
\end_inset

 to (BDIFR/QCR) is about -0.001773 and the latter indicated sensitivity to
 (ADIFR/QCR) of 0.01890.
 When these are forced and the flight data are used to determine further
 dependence, the residual significant dependence was on either XMACH2 or
 (QCF/PSFD), suggesting the following fit: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta p}{\mathrm{PSFD}}=b_{0}+b_{1}\frac{\mathrm{ADIFR}}{\mathrm{QCR}}+b_{2}\mathrm{XMACH2}+b_{3}\frac{\mathrm{BDIFR}}{\mathrm{QCR}}\label{eq:PDORfit2}

\begin_inset Formula $b_{2}=0.01890$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{3}=-0.001773$

 The RMS error for this fit was only slightly higher, for IDEAS flight 8,
 than that given by (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PCORfitQCF"

\end_inset

), but the representation of the maneuvers in flight 5 was improved.
 Under normal conditions the last term makes negligible contribution, but
 it has some effect during the high-sideslip portions of maneuvers so could
 be included without harm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar approach can be taken to determining 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

 for other sensors.
 The results are the same for QCR because, by assumption, the errors arise
 from the static source and this is common between QCF and QCR.
 However, QCR has additional corrections that arise from the flow dependence
 of the dynamic pressure measurement, because this is a radome port instead
 of a pitot-tube measurement and is more sensitive to flow angle.
 On the C-130, another pair of measurements is provided by PSFRD and QCFR;
 these use a different set of static buttons and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p_{R}$
\end_inset

 may have a different functional dependence.
 The same procedure was used to determine fits for this sensor, with these
 results (where PSFD and QCF are replaced in the equations by PSFRD and
 QCFR): {
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2}$
\end_inset

}={-0.00460, 0.0085, 0.0379}.
 These are significantly different from those determined for PSFD and QCF,
 but that is expected because the static ports are in a different location
 on the fuselage and, by hypothesis, they determine these errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One check on this procedure is that, after application of these corrections,
 PSFD and PSFRD should produce the same corrected values.

The mean values for pressure are only about 0.5 mb lower than those now in

There are also some possible alternate approaches:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When LAMS is present, it is possible to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

 continuously from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PCOR2"

\end_inset

) and apply that to the measurements of pressure.
 A problem with this approach is that, while coherence between TASX and
 TAS_LAMS is close to unity for periods of 5 s and longer, below about 5
 s the coherence starts to decrease, so some noise would be introduced by
 making this correction at high rate because the pitot tube and LAMS are
 sensing different air volumes.
 If instead a low-pass filter is applied to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

 with a cutoff of 0.3 Hz, the result is a less noisy correction, but that
 correction will not have some of the needed sensitivity to rapid changes
 in flow angle or airspeed.
 For these reasons, even when LAMS is present, using the parameterized fit
 seems preferable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When LAMS is present, it is also possible to determine the sensitivity of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

 to controlling factors like pressure, dynamic pressure, and angle of attack
 by updating an accumulated fit, weighting recent measurements more highly.
 The advantage would be that, if some change occurs that affects the measurement
 of static pressure (like ice accumulation on the fuselage, power setting,
 use of flaps, perhaps remaining fuel load, etc.), the fit would adjust to
 compensate for this change.
 The drawback is that the equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

 would vary during the flight in ways that make error characterization more
 difficult.
 This is probably best left to a possible special post-processing step for
 use only in cases where highest accuracy is important.

A test of the accuracy of the measurement of dynamic pressure is that the
 longitudinal component of the wind should not change in reverse-heading
 maneuvers in which the aircraft is flown over the same (drifting) flight
 leg twice with opposite headings.
 To isolate the effect of the measurement of

 axis of the aircraft, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{g}\cos\beta-\mathrm{TAS}$

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{g}$
\end_inset

 is the groundspeed of the aircraft and

 Because UXW represents the wind along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft,
 it should reverse sign for the two legs of the maneuver.
 The first pair above has a difference of 0.48 m/s, significantly reduced
 from the standard processing (UX) which shows a difference of 1.42 m/s.
 The second pair gives a larger difference: 2.97 m/s for the new processing
 vs 3.61 m/s for the standard processing.
 Both old and new processing give a larger error than is expected for the
 second pair, although the first pair leads to a quite acceptable difference.
 Analysis of more reverse-heading maneuvers would help evaluate if these
 corrections are acceptable, but the improvement produced in both cases
 by the new fit suggests it is appropriate for use in processing.

m/s.

\begin_layout Standard
The suggested conclusion for both the C-130 and GV is that the LAMS provides
 a valid calibration source for both static and dynamic pressure, and that
 fits to the resulting corrections predicted by LAMS can be used to improve
 the corrections that are applied to static and dynamic pressure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Determining the Air Temperature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once confidence in the pressure measurements has been established as in
 the preceding sections, a check on the absolute accuracy of the temperature
 measurement can be obtained from integration of the hydrostatic equation,
 expressed in this form: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta p_{i}=-\frac{g\, p_{i}}{R_{a}T_{a,i}}\delta z_{i}\label{eq:hydrostaticEq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where {
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i},T_{a,i}$
\end_inset

} are the values of air pressure and temperature for the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th measurement and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta p_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the change in pressure for the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th step, during which the geometric altitude changes by 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta z_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This equation can be rearranged to obtain an estimate of the temperature:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{a,i}=-\frac{g\,}{R_{a}}\frac{\delta z_{i}}{\delta\ln p_{i}}\label{eq:Tfromdzdp}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The altitude change 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta z_{i}$
\end_inset

is provided with high accuracy by GPS measurements: for a climb rate of
 10 m/s, measurement accuracy of 1% in derived temperature requires at least
 1% accuracy in the measurement of the 1-s change, or accuracy of 0.1 m.
 To determine the temperature to 0.1% (as required for a typical error of
 about 0.3
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C), the altitude change must be measured to 1 cm.
 The accuracy approaches this for differential measurements, but a better
 approach is to use longer intervals so that the altitude difference is
 greater -- perhaps 10 s or more.
 The requirement is more stringent on the measurement of pressure.
 In 1 s at 10 m/s climb, the pressure change is less than 1 mb, and it seems
 likely that even differences in pressure cannot be measured confidently
 to better than 0.05 mb, so this would introduce an error of >5% in the deduced
 (absolute) temperature.
 This is inadequate because it leads to errors in the temperature of >13
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C.
 Instead, either longer intervals are needed or many measurements must be
 averaged.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
C-130:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
About 30 min of flight during flight #8 of IDEAS-4 (2309-2341) was devoted
 to repeated climbs and descents, so there are about 1800 measurements and
 it might be expected that the standard error in the determination of temperatur
e from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Tfromdzdp"

\end_inset

) could be reduced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{1800}=42,$
\end_inset

 or to around 0.5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C, by this procedure.
 Alternately, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 temperature between two levels can be determined from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Tfromdzdp"

\end_inset

); for this flight segment, climbs were repeated from about 12-16000 ft,
 or over a pressure range of about 100 mb.
 An uncertainty of 0.1 mb in pressure leads to about an uncertainty of 0.1%
 or, in absolute temperature, an uncertainty of about 0.3
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C in the mean temperature between the layers.
 It should therefore be possible to test the temperature measurements with
 about this level of confidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test this, three sums were used between different flight levels:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{1}=\sum_{i}\frac{R_{a,i}}{g_{i}}\ln\left(\frac{p_{i}}{p_{i-1}}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{2}=\sum_{i}(z_{i}-z_{i-1})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{3}=\sum_{i}\frac{z_{i}-z_{i-1}}{T_{m,i}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{a,i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

 are respectively the gas constant (adjusted for humidity) and the acceleration
 of gravity (adjusted for latitude and altitude) and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{m,i}$
\end_inset

 is the temperature in absolute units, corrected for airspeed but based
 on the measured value.
 The predicted mean temperature for the layer, weighted by altitude, is
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}=-S_{1}/S_{2}$
\end_inset

, while the corresponding weighted-mean measured temperature is 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{T}_{m}=S_{2}/S_{3}$
\end_inset

.

For the record: I did try to fit a linear correction using the measurements
 of RF08, IDEAS-4.
 A least-squares minimization procedure was used: Find the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 that minimize the variance 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \chi^{2}=\sum_{i}}\left(T_{m,i}+c_{0}+c_{1}T_{m,i}-T_{a,i}\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

.
  However, the 1-s values were so variable that the attempt to calculate
 fite coefficients led to a singular inversion, which presumably arose from
 the large numbers entering the fit.
 It may be possible to return to this, but the preceding evidence suggested
 that the temperature measurements are approximately within expected errors
 so I didn't pursue this for the C-130.

GV:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar approach can be taken for the GV, with promise of a larger range
 of calibration points because of the large altitude changes present on
 many of the flights.
 However, because of the existence of many flights with altitude changes
 (e.g., from HIPPO), it was decided to take a different approach in an attempt
 to determine a polynomial-fit correction to the temperature via minimization
 of the error between actual altitude changes and those predicted from integrati
on of the hydrostatic equation.
 The procedure used was as follows:

 where the flaps might be extended), and a total temperature measurement
 like TTHR1.

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(T_{t})=T_{t}+a_{0}+a_{1}T_{t}+a_{2}T_{t}^{2}+...

\end_inset

The vertical integration will match the pressure change only if the atmosphere
 is horizontally homogeneous.
 If not, the results will be biased as the fit attempts to compensate for
 horizontal gradients.
 This can introduce a serious error into the minimization results.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To consider how serious this problem is, it is useful to assess how a pressure
 gradient will affect the results.
 Suppose the pressure gradient along the flight path is 
\begin_inset Formula $dp/ds=G_{p}$
\end_inset

 .
 Then there will be a contribution to the pressure change over a period
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T$
\end_inset

 not associated with an altitude change, of magnitude 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{p}V\Delta T$
\end_inset

, arising just from the pressure gradient, so in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AltitudeChangeEquation"

\end_inset

) the pressure ratio must be modified to be 
\begin_inset Formula $(p_{i}-G_{p}V)/p_{i-1}$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Fortunately, there is a way to measure the horizontal pressure gradient
 because it will be reflected in the change in DVALUE.
 For example, in level flight the change in DVALUE will measure the pressure
 gradient; similarly, in a climb, the change in DVALUE can be compared to
 that expected for the measured temperature vs that of a standard atmosphere,
 so that also can be used as a measure of the pressure gradient.
 For horizontal or nearly horizontal motion (e.g., along pressure surfaces),
 
\begin_inset Formula $(dp/ds=-\rho g\, dH_{p}/ds$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the height at pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 The change 
\begin_inset Formula $dH_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the same as the change in DVALUE.
 The term needed to correct the pressure used in the hydrostatic equation
 is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{p}V\Delta T=-\rho gV\Delta T(dH_{p}/ds)=-\rho g\Delta H_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 In a climb, however, the same correction is not possible because a change
 caused by a horizontal pressure gradient can't be distinguished from one
 caused by a different temperature along the flight path.
 Even at 40,000 ft, though, the GV climbs at above 5 m/s, so the ratio of
 contributions from the horizontal and vertical gradients will be
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{-\rho g\Delta H_{p}}{-\rho g\Delta z}=\frac{V(dH_{p}/ds)}{W}\simeq40\frac{dH_{p}}{ds}
\]

\end_inset

For example, an upper limit to the horizontal height gradient might be 10
 m/100 km or <10
\begin_inset Formula $^{-4}$
\end_inset

; most level flight segments in the HIPPO flights show less than this gradient.
 In this case the vertical gradient would be changed by about 0.004, and
 a temperature change of around 1
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C would be required to produce the same change in the gradient.
 At this level of effect, it seems reasonable to expect that the measurements
 will tend to average toward the correct answer, especially if repeated
 climbs and descents are flown in the same direction so that the effects
 of the horizontal pressure gradient on climbs and descents tend to cancel.
 However, if all points including those from level legs are included, the
 trend that will be present in the horizontal gradient for flights that
 do not return to the starting base can easily be large enough to bias the
 deduced temperature by 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$
\end_inset

 or so.

There are several steps that can be taken to compensate for the horizontal
 pressure gradient:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Use only periods when the climb rate exceeds some threshold (e.g., 2 m/s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use DVALUE measurements from level flight segments to estimate the gradient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use a comparison between pressure measured during climb and descent to estimate
 and remove the gradient.
 For example, it would be possible to determine the height of fixed pressure
 surfaces on climb and again on descent, then use the difference as an estimate
 of the pressure gradient between those locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use the whole-flight average DVALUE (perhaps only from level legs) to determine
 the pressure gradient, and apply a correction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use only flights not returning to the takeoff point, to avoid cases where
 it is not straightforward to determine the gradient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategy that will be tried first is the following: Require fabsf(VSPD)>2.0
 or some other tolerance.
 If the results seem adequate and consistent, stop; otherwise, on each climb
 store values of ALTV at fixed pressures separated by 50 mb, and store the
 locations (lat/long).
 Make a 2nd pass that uses the stored values to determine the pressure gradients
 as a function of time through the flight and adds these to the data files.
 Then use those horizontal pressure gradients to correct the values entering

 Techniques for reducing this variance will be explored in the studies of

The Effect of Flow Angle on Measured Total Pressure from a Pitot Tube
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pitot tubes are designed to be insensitive to airflow conditions at small
 angles from their centerlines and are assumed to deliver the correct total
 pressure under such conditions.
 To check this, a flight segment with LAMS operational included yaw maneuvers
 in which the aircraft was flown in conditions of small sideslip (<3 deg)
 in cross-controlled conditions so that the aircraft continued in approximately
 the same direction and at approximately the same airspeed.
 Under those conditions, one would expect that the total pressure measured
 by the pitot tube would not show a dependence on sideslip angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because a high-accuracy test is desired, small corrections are needed for
 the observed departures from steady flight speed and in altitude.
 Over the course of the maneuver, Global Positioning System measurements
 of altitude were used with the hydrostatic equation to estimate and correct
 for changes in the ambient pressure (via 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta p$
\end_inset

= -
\begin_inset Formula $(p/R_{a}T)g\delta z$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta z$
\end_inset

 is the change in altitude from the start of the flight segment, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the ambient pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{a}$
\end_inset

 the gas constant for air, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 the absolute temperature, and
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 the acceleration of gravity.
 In addition, a correction was made for the expected change in total pressure
 arising from small changes in airspeed, as measured by the LAMS.
 This is an independent measurement of airspeed that does not rely on the
 aircraft measurements of static and dynamic pressure, so the correction
 is not affected by possible errors in the measurement of dynamic pressure.
 The correction applied is given by the following equation:

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta q=\left(\frac{p}{R_{a}T}\left(\frac{v^{2}}{2c_{p}T}+1\right)^{\frac{c_{p}}{R_{a}}-1}v\right)\delta v

which is obtained by differentiating (

\end_inset

).
 In this equation, 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is the airspeed measured by LAMS and the increment is referenced to the
 arbitrary starting value in the time series so that corrections are made
 for the non-steady flight speed during the maneuvers.

The total pressure (from the sum of the static pressure measurement and
 the dynamic pressure measurement) on the C-130 as a function of the magnitude
 of the sideslip angle during yaw maneuvers in which sideslip angles varying
 from 0-3
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

 were forced by rudder action while the aircraft continued on approximately
 a straight-and-level course.
 The mean total pressure of 760 mb has been subtracted from the measurements.
 Error bars are standard deviations in the measurements for the total-pressure
 axis and are the range of the bin used in sideslip.
 Corrections for deviations from a level course and for small variations
 in airspeed have been applied, as discussed in the text.
 The measurements are grouped into 0.5 degree intervals after an initial
 interval of 1 degree to check for changes in the total pressure as a result
 of dependence on sideslip.

With these corrections, the average total pressure measurements as a function
 of the magnitude of the sideslip angle are as shown in Fig.

.
 Within a limit of about 0.1 hPa, there is no dependence on sideslip angle
 out to about 3
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

, a range in sideslip angles and also in attack angles from the mean that
 is characteristic of most normal flight of both NCAR aircraft.
 This is justification for neglecting possible dependence of the total pressure
 measurement on flow angles, at least for the small angles characteristic
 of normal flight conditions.
