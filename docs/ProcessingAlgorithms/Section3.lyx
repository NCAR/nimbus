This was a derived variable incorporating a third-order damping feedback

 Positive values are up.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
PALT is a measure of pressure, not altitude, so this gives false updating
 to pressure fluctuations.
 It would be better to use GALT.

 because that ACINS already incorporates pressure damping).

 is not a true altitude but an altitude equivalent to the ambient pressure

 WP3 was calculated by the data-processing software as follows (with coefficient

Regarding signs, note that ACINS is a number near zero, not near g, and
 so already has the estimated acceleration of gravity removed.
 The assumption made in the following is that the INS will report values
 adjusted for the gravitational acceleration 
\emph on
at the point of alignment
\emph default
, which would be 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{F}$
\end_inset

, the estimate for gravity at the flight altitude (palt) and latitude (lat),
 is 
\emph on
smaller
\emph default
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 then the difference (
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}-g_{f}$
\end_inset

) will be positive; this will correct for the reference value for ACINS
 being the gravity measured at alignment (
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

) when it should actually be the sensed gravity (
\begin_inset Formula $g_{f}$
\end_inset

) at the measurement point, so to obtain (sensed acceleration - 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{f}$
\end_inset

) it is necessary to add (
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}-g_{f}$
\end_inset

) to ACINS, 
\emph on
increasing 
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

acz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this case.
 However, the situation with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vcorac
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is reversed: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vcorac
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a positive term for all eastward flight, for example, but in that case
 the motion of the aircraft makes objects seem lighter (i.e., they experience
 less acceleration of gravity) than without such flight.
 ACINS is positive upward so it represents a net acceleration of the aircraft
 upward (as imposed by the combination of gravity and the lift force of
 the aircraft).
 To accomplish level flight in these circumstances, the aircraft must actually
 accelerate downward so the accelerometer will experience a negative excursion
 relative to slower flight.
 To compensate, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vcorac
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must make a positive contribution to remove that negative excursion from
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

acz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In the conceptual extreme that the aircraft flies fast enough for the interior
 to appear weightless, ACINS would reduce to -1*
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 and vcorac would increase to +
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

, leaving acz near zero as required if the aircraft were to remain in level
 flight in the rotating frame

These are derived outputs obtained by subtracting a fixed reference position
 from the current position.
 The values are determined from measurements of latitude and longitude and
 converted from degrees to distance in a rectilinear coordinate system.
 The reference position can be either the starting location of the flight
 or a user-defined reference point (e.g., the location of a project radar).
 The accuracy of these values is dependent on the accuracy of the source
 of latitude and longitude measurements (see LAT and LON), and the calculations
 are only appropriate for short distances because they do not take into
 account the spherical geometry of the Earth.

 to be 1.5 m CEP horizontal (3.3 m 95% CEP).
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
CEP is the Circular Error Probability, the radius of a circle that contains
 50% of the measurements; 95% CEP contains 95% of the measurements.
 When OnmiSTAR corrections are available (involving extra cost and not available
 in all areas of the globe, so not available for all projects) the uncertainty
 decreases to 0.15 m 95% CEP.
 The vertical uncertainty is about twice as great as the horizontal uncertainty.
 Because variables are stored as 4-byte single-precision floating point
 numbers, the inherent storage precision can limit the precision of the
 recorded position to about 1 m.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The accuracy of velocity measurements is 0.03 m/s RMS for all axes.
 All variables are provided by the GPS receivers at 5 Hz.
 Latitude and longitude are recorded in a special log file (called the GPGGA
 log) with a resolution of 0.0001 degree, while Earth-relative velocity is
 recorded in the GPRMC log with resolution of 0.1 m/s.
 Starting in January 2014 new logs (named BESTPOS and BESTVEL) will also
 be recorded to preserve more significant digits in the measurements.
 The BESTPOS log will have a position resolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-11}\deg$

 Both raw outputs cycle through the range 0-360 degrees, where one cycle
 corresponds to 4,000 feet for HGME and to 100,000 feet for CHGME.
 To resolve the ambiguity arising from these cycles, 4,000-foot increments
 are added to HGME to maintain agreement with CHGME.

Prior to and including some projects in 2010, processing used slightly different
 coefficients: for aircraft other than the GV, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}/\lambda$
\end_inset

 was represented by -43308.83, the reference pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 was taken to be 1013.246, and the exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 was represented numerically by 0.190284.
 For the GV, the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}/\lambda$
\end_inset

 was taken to be 44308.0, the transition pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

 was 226.1551 hPa, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 = 0.190284, and coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{R_{0}^{\prime}T_{T}}{gM_{d}}$
\end_inset

 was taken to be 6340.70 m instead of 6341.620 m as obtained below.
 The difference between these older values and the ones recommended below
 is everywhere less than 10 m and so is small compared to the expected uncertain
ty in pressure measurements, because 1 hPa change in pressure leads to a
 change in pressure altitude that varies from about 8--40 m over the altitude
 range of the GV .)

Derived altitude above the geopotential surface, 
\emph default
obtained by combining information from a GPS receiver and an inertial reference
 system.
 This variable was intended to compensate for times when GPS reception was
 lost by incorporating information from the IRS measurement of altitude.
 GPS status measurements were used to detect signal loss, although sometimes
 this signal was delayed for a few seconds after the signal was lost.
 A 10-second running average was calculated of the difference between the
 GPS altitude and the reference altitude.
 When the sample-to-sample altitude difference changed more than 50 meters
 or when the GPS status detected a degraded signal, the derived variable
 (ALTX or GGALTC) became the alternate reference altitude adjusted by the
 latest running-average difference between that reference altitude and GGALT.
 When reception was recovered, to avoid a sudden discontinuity in altitude,
 the derived variable was adjusted back to the GPS altitude gradually over
 the next 10 seconds.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

This obsolete variable should be used with caution because the reference
 altitude used in past calculations was the IRS altitude updated to the
 pressure altitude of the aircraft.
 To account for the difference between pressure and geometric altitude,
 a regression equation was used, normally 
\begin_inset Formula $z=a_{0}+a_{1}\mathrm{*{PALT}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=-46.3$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}=0.97866$
\end_inset

 but often adjusted dependent on project conditions.
 This introduced problems in early applications with the GV because it did
 not account for the pressure-altitude transition at the ISA tropopause.
 Use of a pressure altitude as reference introduces additional errors in
 altitude in regions that are not barotropic.

When OmniSTAR corrections are available and satellite reception is good,
 the GPS altitude variable GGALT has very low associated uncertainty.
 However, sometimes reception is lost (esp.
\begin_inset space ~

in turns), and OmniSTAR is not available in some locations and for some
 projects.
 In those cases, a variable that combines information from the GPS receiver
 and an inertial reference unit can provide higher-quality measurements
 than either alone.

 The GPS signals at times are degraded, most often during aircraft turns.
 Two GPS status measurements are used to detect this, but sometimes the
 information comes too late.
 A 10-second running average is calculated of the difference between the
 GPS altitude and the reference altitude.
 When the sample-to-sample altitude difference changes more than 50 meters
 or when the GPS status detects a degraded signal, the altitude from this
 measurement changes from GPS altitude to an adjusted reference altitude
 (defined as reference altitude plus the running difference average).
 When the GPS altitude is again

 If the GPS data are missing for a short time (a few seconds to a minute),
 accuracy is not affected.
 However, longer dropouts will result in accuracies degrading toward those
 of the IRU.
 Without the GPS or another ground reference, the IRS error cannot be determined
 empirically, and one should assume that it is within the manufacturer's
 specification (1 nautical mile of error per hour of flight, 90% CEP).
 When the GPS is active, RAF estimates that the correction algorithm produces
 a position with an error less than 1.5 m.

 the GPS is lost for extended periods, provided a good initial fit was obtained.

 The digital filter used is recursive, not centered, to permit calculation
 during a single pass through the data.
 If the cutoff frequency lies where both the GPS and IRU measurements are
 almost the same, then the detailed characteristics of the filter (e.g., phase
 shift) in the transition region do not matter because the complementary
 filters have cancelling effects when applied to the same signal.
 The transition frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}$

 was chosen to be (1/600) Hz.
 The Butterworth filter was chosen because it provides flat response away
 from the transition.

This result is used as long as the GPS signals are continuous and flagged
 as being valid.
 When that is not the case, some means is needed to avoid sudden discontinuities
 in velocity (and hence windspeed), which would introduce spurious effects
 into variance spectra and other properties dependent on a continuously
 valid measurement of wind.
 To extrapolate measurements through periods when the GPS signals are lost
 (as sometimes occurs, for example, in turns) a fit is determined to the
 difference between the best-estimate variables {VNSC,VEWC} and the IRS
 variables {VNS,VEW} for the period before GPS reception was lost, and that
 fit is used to extrapolate through periods when GPS reception is not available.

 so the terms used to determine the fit are exponentially weighted over
 the period of valid data with a time constant that decays exponentially
 into the past with a characteristic time of 30 min.
 This is long enough to determine a significant portion of the Schuler oscillati

 Doing so immediately would introduce a discontinuity in {VNSC,VEWC}, however,

 This has the potential to introduce some artificial variance at this scale
 and so should be considered in cases where variance spectra are analyzed
 in detail, but it has much less influence on such spectra than a discontinuous
 transition would.
 Ideally, the current fit and the last filtered discrepancy (VNSC

it would be desirable to use a gradual transition back to the complementary-filt
ered solution, but this apparently isn't done now; instead, there is a hard
 switch back to use of the complementary-filter solution, without adjustment
 or re-initialization of the past accumulated filters (carried in zf).
 Specifically, if GPS becomes again good while the fit is being used, dvy
 should be moved toward the complementary-filter solution gradually, with
 the same exponential filter used to initiate the use of the fit.
 This would be implemented by replacing the dvy first expression for goodGPS
 .
 Note that there is no need to filter gvns and vns separately, only their
 difference, because the filter is linear.
 Could save two filter steps and arrays: dvy[]=filter(()gvns-vns, zf[]).
 But, if a fit was calculated previously, want to move from that previous
 fit to this result, via something like dvy[] = dvy[]*fctrf[]+(1-fctrf[])*filter
(()gvns-vns, zf[])).
 This introduces another time constant (5.6 min) into the filter that is
 otherwise 10-min, but avoids the sharp transition.
 It compromises the otherwise favorable characteristic of the complementary
 filter that it has no or little effect on the variance spectrum, but dvy
 can be regarded as a correction to vns to correct for long-term drift in
 the IRS, and to the extent that this is true and all variance remains in
 vns then any filtering applied to dvy won't have much effect.
 It may be acceptable to apply this correction always, instead of switching
 it on and off when transitions occur.

obtained by combining information from a GPS receiver and an IRU.
 When OmniSTAR corrections are available and satellite reception is good,
 the GPS altitude variable GGALT has very low associated uncertainty and
 the change represented by this variable is not useful so in those cases
 ALTC is set equal to GGALT.
 However, sometimes reception is lost (esp.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

in turns), and OmniSTAR is not available in some locations and for some
 projects.
 Therefore, a variable that combines information from the GPS receiver and
 an inertial reference unit can be useful.
 As provided by the current Honeywell IRUs, the vertical motion and position
 of the aircraft is adjusted via a baro-inertial feedback loop to match
 the pressure altitude.
 To obtain a variable that is based on the WGS84 coordinate system, the
 longer-term fluctuations in the GPS measurement of altitude are combined
 with the shorter-term fluctuations from the IRU measurement of altitude
 to obtain the new derived variable ALTC.
 The approach resembles that described above for LATC and LONC, except that
 a fit to the Schuler oscillation is not used and integration of the hydrostatic
 equation is used for updating of the IRU altitude in the absence of GPS
 reception.
 The steps are as follows:

 Also increment the value of the new variable ALTC in the same way.
 For both increments, subtract the value 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{b}$
\end_inset

 from VSPD; 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{b}$
\end_inset

 is determined as the bias term in a PID feedback loop described below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Increment the height 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{h}$
\end_inset

 obtained from integration of the hydrostatic equation, using the measured
 pressure change and temperature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use the difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{h}$
\end_inset

 as an error term in a PID feedback loop, to obtain an estimate of the bias
 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{b}$
\end_inset

 in the vertical velocity measurement.
 There is already updating of the IRU-provided vertical velocity, to pressure
 altitude, but this updating is instead to geometric altitude as represented
 by integration of the hydrostatic equation so it helps remove some of the
 false effects on altitude that arise from using pressure altitude.

 The calculation applies the bias term

 calculated above to the IRU-provided measurement of vertical velocity,

 of vertical velocity is used without change.
