First use 'pdftk File.pdf burst' to get individual pages.
Then use batch file to convert to png pages at high resolution.
(or learn how to convert resolution via 'convert' instead of 'gs')
Import into libreoffice using position/size settings of 0,0,11.0
Finally, export as .ppt (have had some problems with pptx recently)
