\section{EXPERIMENTAL VARIABLES}

This bulletin does not document experimental variables, conventionally
denoted by variable names starting with 'X'. Project documentation
should be consulted for such variables. Many projects also include
measurements from instruments provided by investigators outside NCAR/RAF.
Identification of those variables, and processing algorithms, are
contained in the project documentation and/or the NETCDF headers.
