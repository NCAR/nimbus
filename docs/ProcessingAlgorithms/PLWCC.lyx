 The power

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of operating temperature should be made with consideration of
 three factors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A high temperature increases the dry-air heat losses and so increases the
 uncertainty introduced by the dry term.using 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A low temperature may allow the accumulation of water and lead to errors
 when that water is shed instead of evaporated.
 From Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

A1 in King et al., it is evident that a relatively high operating temperature
 is needed to avoid shedding at GV flight speeds, which are up to about
 3-4 times as high as used for this plot.
 Because the function plotted varies as 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{4/3}$
\end_inset

 and linearly as 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, the liquid water content that will lead to shedding at three times the
 flight speed is about 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3^{3/4}\simeq0.44$
\end_inset

 times as large as in this plot, which emphasizes that the temperature should
 be above about 75
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C to avoid shedding from saturation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The temperature should be below the boiling point of water (according to
 King et al., 1978) to avoid formation of an insulating vapor layer on the
 surface of the probe and possible reduced evaporation times and/or shedding.
 At GV flight altitudes, the boiling point can be lowered significantly,
 but there is usually no liquid water content at such altitudes.
 To ensure operation to -35
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C, where the typical pressure is around 370 hPa, this requirement would
 call for a temperature below about 75
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These requirements appear to call for a wire temperature around 75
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C for the GV and perhaps higher for the C-130 to account for the lower flight
 speed and potential to encounter higher values of liquid water content.
 However, early operators of the probe found that the third requirement
 was not needed, so probes are often operated above the boiling point now.
 The probe recently has been operated well above this temperature, at about
 130
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C for the GV and 162

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The thermal conductivity of air appears to be incorrect and is undocumented
 and unreferenced.
 This is an important property that affects the magnitude of the dry-air
 term, so incorrect values can affect the accuracy of results and lead to
 incorrect calibrations of the Nusselt number.
 A comparison of the thermal-conductivity equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:thermalConductivityNow"

\end_inset

) to the formula of Pruppacher and Klett gives, for 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{m}=273.15,$
\end_inset

5.87 vs 5.69 (P&K); for 293.15
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

K, 6.21 vs 6.03; for 243.15
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

K, 5.34 vs 5.18 (P&K).
 The values being used are thus about 3% high in comparison to those of
 Pruppacher and Klett.
 This difference is significant and worth correcting in future processing,
 esp.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

because I could find no documentation or reference for the formula being
 used.
 However, the only effects have been on the dry-air term, so with baseline
 removal the error would be removed and there should be no need for reprocessing
 of past data for this reason.

 A fairly consistent relationship is shown, except for a set of points offset
 from the main correlation line to the right and then scattered along the
 constant-Nu line; this corresponds to the time during descent and approach
 when the flaps and gear were deployed and the angle of attack abruptly
 increased by about 2
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

 This suggests some effect on flow conditions, perhaps as a result of the
 associated change in angle of attack, as would be expected for heat loss
 from a cylinder if flow angle along the cylinder changes.
 It is not clear why there is also a break in the otherwise linear correlation
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{10}$
\end_inset

(Re) about 3.86.
 Because there are significant changes in angle of attack at times when
 the liquid water content is most interesting (in cumulus clouds with vigorous
 updrafts or downdrafts), this possible dependence on flow angles should
 be investigated further but won't be addressed in this memo.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One would expect (and discussions of hot-wire-anemometers confirm) that
 the primary effect of a flow angle would be to change the effective cooling
 velocity to that component perpendicular to the wire; i.e., the effect could
 be estimated by replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ReynoldsNumber"

\end_inset

) with 
\begin_inset Formula $V\cos(\alpha)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the angle of attack.
 However, the King probe is oriented horizontally on the GV, so angle of
 attack does not influence the angle of flow relative to the sensing wire
 except indirectly via possible changes in airspeed or sideslip flow angle
 associated with changes in angle of attack.
 For a typical angle of attack of 2
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, changing to 4
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, the change in 
\begin_inset Formula $V\cos(\alpha)$
\end_inset

 is about 0.2% or a change of about 0.005 in the base-10 logarithm of the
 Reynolds number.
 The offset in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Pdry vs Re PREDICT rf01"

\end_inset

 is much larger, about 0.04, so this does not seem to be a possible explanation
 unless the normal flow angle is significantly different from the angle
 of attack.
 The same is true for reasonable larger offsets from orientation along the
 axis of the flow; for example, if the offset is 10
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, the difference in the perpendicular component of the flow speed would
 be only 0.007 in natural logarithm for a 2
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 change.
 Nevertheless, fits to the data showed significant improvement with inclusion
 of the angle of attack, even when the anomalous measurements during approach
 were excluded.
 This suggests that the effect on flow must not be a simple change proportional
 to the change in angle of attack but a more serious flow distortion resulting
 in changed airflow at the sensing wire.

 The standard error for the regression line following (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:NuFitEquation"

) was 0.005 in the base-10 logarithm of Nu, or an uncertainty of about 0.2%

 This good result arises partly because there are a large number of points
 where the correlation is very good and only a few where the angle of attack
 produced a departure.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Removing baseline drift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scheme in use now corrects for drift by removing from all measurements
 the average value of liquid water content accumulated from recent out-of-cloud
 measurements.
 This is equivalent to removing the average value of the term involving
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{dry}$
\end_inset

 in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:LWC"

\end_inset

) from the final value for liquid water content.
 Because this term involves the airspeed and temperature as well as power
 from the probe, removal of the baseline in this way can fail to track variation
s during cloud penetrations that are real.
 It would be better to attempt to correct the dry-air term 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{dry}$
\end_inset

 only by adjusting the Nu-Re relationship because that then retains other
 dependences like that on airspeed.
 One way to accomplish this, equivalent to removing the baseline in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{dry}$
\end_inset

 directly, is to accumulate the best estimate of the first fit coefficient
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}$
\end_inset

 in the relationship Nu=
\begin_inset Formula $10^{a_{0}}$
\end_inset

Re
\begin_inset Formula $^{a_{1}}=A_{N}\mathrm{Re}^{a_{1}}$
\end_inset

, while keeping the second coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 constant.
 Observed relationships like that in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Pdry vs Re PREDICT rf01"

\end_inset

 indicate that variations occurring in flights are offsets in this coefficient,
 except for the break that occurs as ln(Re)=3.86, and it is straightforward
 to show that the value determined by least-squares fit with slope constrained
 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
a_{0}=\overline{{\log_{10}(\mathrm{Nu})}}-a_{1}\,\overline{{\log_{10}(\mathrm{Re})}}\label{eq:a0Equation}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(where the bar over quantities indicates average value over the fit interval).
 Baseline removal can be accomplished by accumulating estimates of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\mathrm{ln(Nu)}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\mathrm{ln(Re)}}$
\end_inset

 out of cloud and then using (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:a0Equation"

\end_inset

) to update the relationship giving Nu and hence giving 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{dry}$
\end_inset

.
 The two average terms in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:a0Equation"

\end_inset

) can be estimated by simple exponential updating, via 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}$
\end_inset

+=(
\begin_inset Formula $x-\bar{x})/\tau$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the time constant (in units of update periods) for the averaging.
 This is equivalent to similar updating of the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Because Nu=
\begin_inset Formula $A_{N}$
\end_inset

Re
\begin_inset Formula $^{a_{1}}=10^{a_{0}}$
\end_inset

Re
\begin_inset Formula $^{a_{1}}$
\end_inset

, updating 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}$
\end_inset

 in this way is equivalent to updating 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{N}$
\end_inset

 in a similar way, giving a new value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{N}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 after adjustment toward the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{N}$
\end_inset

 that would give the right relationship between an new observed Nu
\begin_inset Formula $^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 and Re
\begin_inset Formula $^{\prime}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
A_{N}^{\prime}=A_{N}+\frac{\mathrm{\frac{\mathrm{Nu}^{\prime}}{\mathrm{Re^{a_{1}}}}-A_{N}}}{\tau}\label{eq:AsubNUpdate}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible procedure to remove the offset is then, for each observation,
 calculate the following:
\end_layout

\mathrm{Nu=\frac{P_{dry}}{\pi l\lambda(T_{m})(T_{W}-T)}}\]

\begin_layout Subsection*
The Boiling Point
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If water evaporates at the boiling point rather than at the wire temperature,
 the temperature at which water boils is needed to determine the liquid
 water content from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:LWC"

\end_inset

).
 This may be of particular significance for the GV because the boiling point
 is reduced to around 75
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C where the temperature is -35
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C and so there might be liquid water.
 At lower temperature, there is some observed response to ice, but it isn't
 known if this can be quantitative or at what temperature evaporation would
 occur.
 Still, it is probably worthwhile to include the boiling-point temperature
 in all calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boiling point is a function only of total pressure, so it is straightforward
 to determine that function from the vapor-pressure dependence on temperature
 as represented, e.g., by Murphy and Koop (2005).
 This is the same relationship discussed in the note on water vapor pressure,
 where it was necessary to determine the dew-point temperature from the
 vapor pressure, except in this case the vapor pressure is the total pressure
 and the dew point is instead the boiling-point temperature.
 High accuracy is probably not warranted because the actual wire temperature,
 as well as the temperature at which water evaporates, is uncertain, so
 it should be adequate to use interpolation in a table of boiling-point
 temperatures to find the boiling point from the ambient pressure.
 However, the pressure at the probe is further affected by dynamic compression,
 so the pressure to be used might be better approximated by the total or
 pitot pressure than by the ambient pressure.

 The top panel shows the result of calculating the liquid water content
 from the King probe in the way outlined above (using code like that at
 the end of this note).
 The procedure provides a good baseline and reasonable responses associated
 with the locations where the CDP also has measurable concentrations.
 The offset removal in the standard processing clearly is not working, and
 there are extended variations near the first jump in LWC that appear to
 be false.
 The magnitude of the response is also slightly larger in the new processing,
 by about 10%.
 This arises mostly from different representation of the wire temperature
 and the temperature dependence of the latent heat of vaporization.

 The value produced by the standard processing is typically about 92% of
 the value produced by the new processing.
 This difference arises mostly from the change in latent heat of vaporization
 and not from change in either the Nu-Re relationship or use of the adjusted
 wire temperature, because the former is close to the new relationship determine
