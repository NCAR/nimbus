Abstract = {{The HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) programme has completed
   three of five planned aircraft transects spanning the Pacific from 85
   degrees N to 67 degrees S, with vertical profiles every approximately
   2.2 degrees of latitude. Measurements include greenhouse gases,
   long-lived tracers, reactive species, O-2/N-2 ratio, black carbon (BC),
   aerosols and CO2 isotopes. Our goals are to address the problem of
   determining surface emissions, transport strength and patterns, and
   removal rates of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols at global scales
   and to provide strong tests of satellite data and global models. HIPPO
   data show dense pollution and BC at high altitudes over the Arctic,
   imprints of large N2O sources from tropical lands and convective storms,
   sources of pollution and biogenic CH4 in the Arctic, and summertime
   uptake of CO2 and sources for O-2 at high southern latitudes. Global
   chemical signatures of atmospheric transport are imaged, showing
   remarkably sharp horizontal gradients at air mass boundaries, weak
   vertical gradients and inverted profiles (maxima aloft) in both
   hemispheres. These features challenge satellite algorithms, global
   models and inversion analyses to derive surface fluxes. HIPPO data can
   play a crucial role in identifying and resolving questions of global
   sources, sinks and transport of atmospheric gases and aerosols.}},
