abstract = {The influence of clouds and ground fog on CO2 cw laser Doppler wind measurements in the atmosphere is discussed. There is an influence if the focal volume of a laser Doppler anemometer is outside the cloud or fog region. Limitations of the application of the LDA to routine remote wind sensing are presented.},
