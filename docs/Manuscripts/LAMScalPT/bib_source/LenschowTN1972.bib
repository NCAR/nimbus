abstract = {This report describes methods used to measure air velocity and temperature from an aircraft and their applications to the measuring system on the NCAR Buffalo aircraft. Main Component of this system are inertial navigation systems, air sensing probe, and a second pitot-static tube. Equations used in calculations, use, limitations, and errors in measurement are discussed.},
