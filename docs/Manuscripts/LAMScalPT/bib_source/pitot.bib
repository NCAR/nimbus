Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method that uses an aircraft with a single-antenna
   GPS receiver and Pitot tube to estimate wind speed and direction and to
   calibrate the airspeed. This sensor combination alone does not determine
   the true attitude of the aircraft, so the wind parameters cannot be
   obtained directly from the measurements. However, if the aircraft flies
   at different headings, such as in banking turns or circle maneuvers, the
   wind magnitude and direction can be estimated from the geometrical
   relation between the wind and the measurements. An extended Kalman
   filter (EKF) is applied to estimate wind parameters. The EKF can also
   estimate the scaling factor used to convert dynamic pressure to
   airspeed. This is useful for the operation of small unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs) because of difficulty in determining the airspeed
   scaling factor of a low-cost UAV. Simulations are performed for a
   constant 2-D wind. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method,
   flight tests of a small UAV are conducted. Simulations and flight test
   results show that the proposed method is effective.}},

Title = {{Air velocity and flow measurement using a Pitot tube}},
Journal = {{ISA TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{257-263}},
Abstract = {{The accurate measurement of both air velocity and volumetric airflow can
   be accomplished using a Pitot tube, a differential pressure transducer,
   and a computer system which includes the necessary hardware and software
   to convert the raw transducer signals into the proper engineering units.
   The incorporation of sensors to measure the air temperature, barometric
   pressure, and relative humidity can further increase the accuracy of the
   velocity and flow measurements. The Pitot tube measures air velocity
   directly by means of a pressure transducer which generates an electrical
   signal which is proportional to the difference between the pressure
   generated by the total pressure and the still air (static pressure). The
   volumetric flow is then calculated by measuring the average velocity of
   an air stream passing through a passage of a known diameter. When
   measuring volumetric how, the `passage of a known diameter' must be
   designed to reduce air turbulence as the air mass flows over the Pitot
   tube. Also, the placement of the pitot tube in the passage will
   influence how accurately the measured flow tracks the actual Bow through
   the passage. Calibrating the measurement system in a wind tunnel can
   further increase the accuracy of the velocity and the flow measurements.
   This objective of this paper is to provide the field engineer with
   single, concise source of information on Bow measurement using a Pitot
   tube. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
