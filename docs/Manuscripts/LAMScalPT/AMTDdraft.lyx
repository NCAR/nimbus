A new laser air-motion sensor measures the true airspeed with an uncertainty
 of less than 0.1

 (standard error) and so reduces uncertainty in the measured component of
 the relative wind along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft to about
 the same level.
 The calculated pressure expected from that airspeed at the inlet of a pitot
 tube then provides a basis for calibrating the measurements of dynamic
 and static pressure, reducing standard-error uncertainty in those measurements
 to less than 0.3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa and the precision applicable to steady flight conditions to about 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa.
 These improved measurements of pressure, combined with high-resolution
 measurements of geometric altitude from the Global Positioning System,
 then indicate (via integrations of the hydrostatic equation during climbs
 and descents) that the offset and uncertainty in temperature measurement
 for one research aircraft are 
\begin_inset Formula $+0.3\pm0.3\unit{\degree C}$
\end_inset

.
 For airspeed, pressure and temperature these are significant reductions
 in uncertainty vs.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

those obtained from calibrations using standard techniques.
 Finally, it is shown that the new laser air-motion sensor, combined with
 parametrized fits to correction factors for the measured dynamic and ambient
 pressure, provides a measurement of temperature that is independent of
 any other temperature sensor.

\begin_layout Standard
Many of the core measurements made from research aircraft are interconnected.
 To measure temperature, corrections must be made for dynamic heating caused
 by the motion of the aircraft; to measure airspeed, measurements of dynamic
 pressure, ambient pressure and temperature are needed; corrections are
 often made to the measured pressure that depend on the airspeed and/or
 orientation of the aircraft; accurate measurement of airspeed depends on
 knowing the humidity of the air and so the appropriate gas constants and
 specific heats; measurements of humidity by dew-point sensors must be corrected
 for differences between ambient and sensor pressures; etc.
 There are seldom standards or reliable references for any of these, so
 uncertainty analyses involve complicated and multi-dimensional examinations
 of these interactions and of how flight conditions might influence measurements
 from otherwise carefully calibrated sensors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one could obtain a reliable reference for any of these interlinked measuremen
ts, it could be of great value in reducing measurement uncertainty.
 A new instrument, a Laser Air Motion Sensor (LAMS), now provides such a
 reference on the National Science Foundation / National Center for Atmospheric
 Research (NSF/NCAR) Gulfstream GV and C-130 research aircraft (hereafter
 referred to as the GV and C-130).
 This paper explores how measurements from that instrument can reduce measuremen
t uncertainties in some key measurements made on those aircraft.
 The new sensor is compact and designed to be mounted in standard instrument
 canisters, so the measurements and approach taken here can be extended
 readily to most other research aircraft.

The trailing cone.

\emph default
 This is usually considered the best standard.
 A tube with inlets around its circumference is trailed so as to be aligned
 with its long axis along the airflow.
 A cone is attached to the end of the line to keep the end of the line aligned
 along the airflow, and the sensor is trailed behind the aircraft at a distance
 and vertical displacement sufficient to be outside airflow effects of the
 aircraft, The inlets are connected by tubing to sensors inside the aircraft,
 and the measurement so obtained is compared to that from the sensors being
 calibrated.

 and many others have described this system.
 It can be used while the aircraft airspeed, altitude and attitude angles
 are changed through the normal flight envelope.
 Disadvantages are that the system usually requires a special and difficult
 installation, which can be particularly problematic for a pressurized aircraft
 flying at low pressure, and the trailing cone is not suitable for routine
 measurement.
 When available, though, it provides accurate calibration;

 uncertainty of about 0.2 hPa, in ideal conditions, using a trailing cone.

Inter-comparisons.

\emph default
 Research aircraft are often flown in formation to collect measurements
 that identify differences.
 There are many published examples, but most identify differences outside
 the claimed error limits and seldom are able to determine which measurement
 is at fault.

Flight past towers.

\emph default
 Flight past high towers or tethered balloon sensors can provide limited
 checks on the accuracy of measured pressures, but these are only possible
 at low altitude and low airspeed so are not suited to calibration of an
 aircraft like the GV.

\emph on
Calibration by the Global Positioning System (GPS) where the wind is known.
 
\emph default
If the wind is known accurately by independent measurement, the drift measured
 by GPS can be compared to the drift expected in the wind measured by the
 aircraft, and the associated dynamic pressure can be corrected to minimize
 the difference from the independent measurement of wind.
 Examples are discussed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

, where dynamic pressure was calibrated by comparing wind measured on the
 aircraft to that measured from a tethered balloon.
 GPS measurements have also been used without an independent reference,
 with flight manoeuvres and Kalman filtering, to calibrate dynamic pressure
 (

 showed that multiple measurements of pressure at ports on the surface of
 a sphere can be used to determine the error in measured ambient pressure
 and, when combined with GPS measurements, can lead to corrections for errors
 introduced by accelerated motion of the aircraft.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis that follows demonstrates that the LAMS provides another means
 of calibrating pressure, one that matches the trailing cone for accuracy
 while providing calibrations that can be available for routine use.
 The operating principles of the LAMS are discussed in the next section.
 The absolute measurement of airspeed that the LAMS provides makes it possible
 to deduce the expected dynamic pressure (or the pressure increase above
 ambient or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

static
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pressure that occurs when air is brought to a stagnation point in flight)
 with improved accuracy.
 It will be argued that this measured correction to the dynamic pressure
 can then be used to improve measurements of the ambient pressure.
 Once pressure is known with small uncertainty, temperature differences
 can be determined during altitude changes by integration of the hydrostatic
 pressure between flight levels because the geometric altitudes of the bounding
 flight levels are also known with improved accuracy from recent improvements
 in measurements from the global positioning system.
 Finally, it is shown that the LAMS can provide a measurement of temperature
 that is independent of normal temperature sensors.
 This measurement should be valid during cloud penetrations as well as in
 clear air.
 The conclusions of the paper then will summarize how this analysis has
 reduced measurement uncertainty for key state-parameter measurements from
 these research aircraft.

 It is a single-beam system in which a laser is focused ahead of the aircraft

 Two different configurations were used in this study.

The wing pod design was changed between the August 2010 flights on the GV
 and the Nov 2011 flights on the C130.
 The flights on the GV used 2" window and had a 30 m range to focus (16
 meters ahead of the nose.) The C-130 flights used the new wing pod design
 which uses a 1" window with a distance to focus of 15 meters (not sure
 how far ahead of the nose this is on the C130).
 The sample volume is the same for both.

There may be some concern about the stability of the laser wavelength since
 we claim it is known with high accuracy.

 It is a DFB fibre laser module (NKT Basik E15) with a wavelength 1559.996

\begin_inset Formula $p$

 Furthermore, small errors in 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and

 will have a small effect on the deduced dynamic pressure because expected
 errors are a small fraction of the total ambient pressure or the absolute

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Corrections are usually applied to measurements of dynamic pressure on research
 aircraft, including the NSF/NCAR research aircraft, so comparing

 is an exaggeration of the improvement that LAMS provides.
 Nevertheless, Fig.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows that the difference between the predicted value from LAMS using (

\end_inset

) and the direct measurement (from one of the pitot tubes on the C-130 reference
d to the static pressure source) is substantial and exhibits both a large
 bias and significant scatter.
 Applying corrections to the direct measurement is therefore important if
 the air motion relative to the aircraft is to be determined accurately.

\begin_layout Subsection
Ambient or static pressure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The normal measurement of total pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}=p+q$
\end_inset

 is obtained on the GV and C-130 and most other research aircraft by measuring
 the pressure delivered by a pitot tube aligned approximately along the
 airflow.
 This measurement is made by adding two measurements, one of ambient pressure
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 (measured by a Parascientific Model 1000 absolute pressure transducer with
 measurement uncertainty 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa, connected in parallel to static ports on each side of the fuselage
 of the aircraft) and a second of dynamic pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 (measured by a Honeywell PPT (0-5 PSI) differential sensor with measurement
 uncertainty 0.02
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa, connected between the static ports and the pressure delivered by a
 pitot tube).
 Two independent systems, with separate static ports, are available on the
 C-130, but only one on the GV.
 On both, there are also measurements from another independent system that
 supplies information to the flight crew but is also recorded for research
 use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pitot tubes are generally insensitive to small deviations from normal flow
 angles, typically delivering accurate total pressure within about 0.1% for
 flow angles up to several degrees from the centreline of the pitot tube

 see also Appendix B).
 However, static ports can deliver pressures that depart much more from
 the true ambient pressure at the flight level when flow around the fuselage
 varies, and they can also produce biases even at normal flight angles,
 so the largest error is expected in 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and consequently in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 while their sum 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 has a substantially smaller error.
 This was checked on the GV and on the C-130 by comparing redundant sources
 for these measurements.
 For example, on the NSF/NCAR C-130, there are two independent sets of static
 ports and pitot tubes, and on the GV there are also redundant sensors as
 part of the avionics package for the aircraft.
 Comparisons examining these independent pairs showed that the results for
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$

 were remarkably consistent among all pairs (agreeing to within 0.1

Some refinements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of these analyses is to determine state variables like pressure
 with significantly less uncertainty than has been possible in the past,
 so this objective requires attention to some minor error sources.
 Specifically, it was necessary to consider: (i) the humidity of the air
 and its effect on thermodynamic properties like the gas constant and specific
 heats; (ii) possible effects of flow angles on the total pressure measured
 by the pitot tube; and (iii) the effect of small departures of the pointing
 angle of the LAMS beam from the direction of the relative wind.

 The error is in the direction of measuring too low a total pressure as
 the flow angle increases, and to some extent it is compensated by orienting
 the pitot tubes along the average flow direction expected in normal flight.
 To verify that the pitot-tube measurements are insensitive to the variations
 in flow angles expected in normal flight, an analysis is presented in Appendix
 B based on yaw manoeuvres flown with the LAMS\SpecialChar \@.
 The analysis indicates that
 measured total pressure remains constant, at a level of about 0.1

can this be tested vs AOA using measurements? a) LAMS gives predicted value
 along longitudinal axis; after correction, gives magnitude of relative
 wind and so predicted value for q.
 If LAMS is used directly for the correction (i.e., not the fit, which includes
 an AOA dependence), a plot of mean correction factor vs AOA should characterize
 this dependence.
 Use manoeuvres for this to minimize effect of other factors like Mach No?
 Alas, no, because manoeuvre probably affects static defect so there will
 be an effect on predicted vs measured q arising from that, and that can't
 be separated from an effect on AOA.
 Still, if no mean dependence is found, that would argue for validity of
 both (and lack of dependence on attach or sideslip in fits for PCORS argues
 for this.
 Worth a look, if regions are controlled for Mach No and q which are shown
 significant dependences in the fits.

(iii).
 Effects of LAMS orientation.

\bar default
 Because there was an inertial reference system mounted on the same under-wing
 pylon that carried the LAMS, it was possible to correct for small departures
 in pointing angle relative to the aircraft reference line, the orientation
 of which was also measured by a separate inertial reference system.
 In addition, a correction is needed if the airflow angle is not along the
 centreline of the pitot tube, as when the angle of attack differs from
 that represented by the orientation of the pitot tube.
 Although the pitot tube is relatively insensitive to flow angles and so
 measures the total dynamic pressure, LAMS measures the relative wind in
 a specific direction.
 For LAMS, the effect of a flow angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 relative to the beam is that it measures 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{l}=v\,\cos(\theta)$
\end_inset

.
 The beam is oriented close to but slightly offset from the longitudinal
 axis of the aircraft, at viewing angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$

 above and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}$

 to the starboard side of the longitudinal axis.
 Then, with side-slip

 positive for relative wind approaching from the starboard side of the aircraft,

Uncertainty in the corrections
\end_layout

When the LAMS is operating, the corrections to ambient and dynamic pressure
 can be determined directly from (

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PCOR2-1"

\end_inset

), and these corrections have much stronger justification than the empirical
 corrections used previously.
 The LAMS evaluation (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "SpulerEtAl2011"

\end_inset

) suggests that the uncertainty in line-of-sight 
\begin_inset Formula $v$

 is about 0.05
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

, so this is also approximately the uncertainty in the component of the
 relative wind along the axis of LAMS\SpecialChar \@.
 The total derivative of (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:qFromLAMS-1"

\end_inset

) provides a basis for evaluating the uncertainty in the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 estimated from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

):
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta q}{p}=\left(\frac{v^{2}}{2c_{p}T}+1\right)^{\frac{c_{p}}{R_{a}}-1}\frac{v^{2}}{R_{a}T}\left(\frac{\delta v}{v}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta T}{T}\right)\,\,\,.\label{eq:qDerivative}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The temperature uncertainty thus contributes significantly to the uncertainty
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, often more than the uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 from LAMS, because 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta v/v\approx0.05/220\approx0.000$

\begin_inset Formula $\approx$

0.00067 (for the GV).
 To reduce the uncertainty in temperature used in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:qFromLAMS-1"

\end_inset

), the airspeed from LAMS can be used directly in the correction for dynamic
 heating, avoiding uncertainty in the conventional airspeed arising from
 error in measured dynamic pressure.
 That is, the temperature should be determined directly from
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T=T_{r}-\alpha\frac{v_{l}^{2}}{2c_{p}}\label{eq:dynHeatingcorrUsingLAMS}
\end{equation}

 The uncertainty in the uncorrected measurement of

 uncertainty of around 0.16

 Evaluation at 150 hPa leads to a similar estimate of uncertainty.
 When LAMS is present, it is thus possible to be confident that the measurements

Fits to the corrections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is still value in determining fits to the corrections provided by
 LAMS in terms of flight characteristics like flight level, angle of attack,
 Mach number, etc., because then corrections can be applied in cases where
 the LAMS is not present or does not detect enough signal to provide a valid
 airspeed.
 Such fits can be applied retrospectively to data collected before the LAMS
 was available, and the fits can also be compared to other means of estimating
 the corrections.
 A further reason for developing fits is that the LAMS measurement, being
 offset from the nose of the aircraft, can sense fluctuations from the condition
s present at the nose, and averaging over such fluctuations as provided
 by functional fits smooths the predicted corrections.
 Fits to the measurements can therefore be more accurate than those corrected
 directly using the LAMS airspeed 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{l}$
\end_inset

.
 For these reasons, fits to the measurements provided by (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PCOR2-1"

\end_inset

) were explored until adequate representations of the predicted fits were
 found.
 Dependent variables in the fits included ambient pressure, dynamic pressure,
 Mach number, angle of attack, side-slip, airspeed, and other characteristics
 of flight.
 The following analyses use flights during which the LAMS provided valid
 measurements almost continuously and during which there were many altitude
 changes and speed variations.

Wind measurements in reverse-heading manoeuvres
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A reverse-heading manoeuvre is one in which a straight-and-level flight
 leg is flown for a short time (2--5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

min) and then the aircraft reverses course and flies the same leg in the
 opposite direction.
 Usually these are flown approximately along and against the wind direction.
 A test of the accuracy of the measurement of dynamic pressure is that the
 longitudinal component of the wind should reverse direction but have the
 same magnitude in reverse-heading manoeuvres when the aircraft is flown
 over the same (drifting) flight leg twice with opposite headings.
 To isolate the effect of the measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and hence true airspeed, the best wind component to use is that along the
 axis of the aircraft, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{g}\cos\delta-v_{t}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{g}$
\end_inset

 is the ground speed of the aircraft, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{t}$
\end_inset

 the true airspeed relative to the air, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the angle between the ground-speed vector and the heading of the aircraft.
 The GPS system provides the ground-speed

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The avionics pressure system of the GV
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ambient pressure measurement from the avionics system on the GV is more
 reliable than those on many research aircraft because the GV is certified
 to fly on RVSM (reduced vertical separation minimum) levels so the flight-deck
 pressure measurement has met strict Federal Aviation Administration requirement
s.
 Appendix G to Federal Aviation Regulations Part 91 specifies that the maximum
 allowable error in altitude is 80
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

ft, or about 24
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m.
 In the RVSM altitude range (flight levels 290 to 410), this corresponds
 to a requirement that the error in pressure be in the range from about
 0.68
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa (near FL410) to 1.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa (near FL290).
 For the GV flight used above, the mean difference between the pressure
 provided by the avionics system and that measured with correction by LAMS,
 for the RVSM altitude range, was +0.36
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa with standard deviation 0.19
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

hPa, so within the tolerance required by RVSM standards the avionics pressure
 is consistent with the measured pressure as calibrated in this study.

 on the validity of the corrections.
 Repeatedly during the flight used to determine the pressure calibration
 in this study, the GV was flown in level flight moving from near its low-speed
 limit to near its high-speed limit.
 If the pressure corrections are adequate, such manoeuvres should not introduce
 perturbations into the measured pressure fields.
 A stringent test of this expected independence of Mach number is to consider
 the difference between the geometric altitude and the pressure altitude,

 This compensates for small altitude changes of the aircraft and should
 show a continuous change not perturbed by the airspeed changes or small
 altitude changes.

\begin_layout Standard
When the aircraft, at about 450
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

 there was a clear perturbation in the d-value plot during the transitions
 from and back to flight at Mach 0.67 to Mach 0.73, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 However, during the flight segments at steady speed the various measurements
 of d-value are consistent to within about 3

 In the higher Mach-number range of the flight envelope, deviations were
 still smaller, consistent with linear change with time to within about
 0.1

 This is an indication that the larger deviations of the fit from the LAMS-measu
red values occur at the extremes of the flight envelope, and that errors

\begin_layout Section
Correcting the measured airspeed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LAMS provides a direct measurement of airspeed, but it is still useful
 to use the pressures as determined in the preceding section to determine
 airspeed by solving (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

) for 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 Because the volume in which LAMS senses the airspeed is displaced from
 the nose of the aircraft, the airspeed that it senses may differ slightly
 from that sensed at the radome of the aircraft.
 For the GV, the difference between the airspeed measured by LAMS and that
 determined from the corrected dynamic and ambient pressures has a standard
 deviation of 0.35

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

, and estimates based on measured turbulence levels indicate that this is
 similar to the difference expected for sample locations separated by about
 16 m, the distance between the LAMS sensing volume and the nose of the
 GV.
 For this reason, airspeed used to determine the wind is better if based
 on the corrected pressures even when LAMS is present.

 aircraft by calculating height differences from integration of the hydrostatic
 equation and comparing to measured height differences.
 The latter are provided with low uncertainty by modern GPS measurements
 of geometric altitude.
 The improved accuracy in the measurement of pressure provided by LAMS reduces
 the uncertainty in the measurement of pressure differences and enables
 a more stringent test of the validity of the measurements of temperature.

The hydrostatic equation can be expressed in this form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta p_{i}=-\frac{g\, p_{i}}{R_{a}T_{i}}\delta z_{i}\label{eq:hydrostaticEq-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where {
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i},\, T_{i}$
\end_inset

} are the values of ambient pressure and absolute temperature for the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th measurement and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta p_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the change in pressure for the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th step, during which the geometric altitude changes by 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta z_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This equation can be rearranged to obtain an estimate of the temperature:

\begin{equation}
T_{i}=-\frac{g\,}{R_{a}}\frac{\delta z_{i}}{\delta\ln p_{i}}\,\,\,.\label{eq:Tfromdzdp-1}

 A least-squares minimization procedure was used: Find the values of

 However, the 1-s values were so variable that the attempt to calculate
 fit coefficients led to a singular inversion, which presumably arose from
 the large numbers entering the fit.
 It may be possible to return to this, but the preceding evidence suggested
 that the temperature measurements are approximately within expected errors

 to determine a polynomial correction to the temperature via minimization

 The chi-square (

Because the climbs and descents were made en route and so spanned some horizonta
l distance, the vertical integration will match the pressure change only
 if the atmosphere is horizontally homogeneous.
 If not, the results will be biased as the fit attempts to compensate for
 horizontal gradients, and this can introduce an error into the minimization
 results.
 To consider how serious this problem is, it is useful to assess how a pressure
 gradient will affect the results.
 Suppose the horizontal pressure gradient along the flight path is 
\begin_inset Formula $dp/ds=G_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 Then there will be a contribution to the pressure change arising just from
 the pressure gradient over a period 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$

\begin_inset Formula $G_{p}v\Delta t$

It is convenient to express this in terms of d-value, the difference between
 geometric altitude and pressure altitude, because that is measured routinely.
 Part of the change in d-value during a climb results from the horizontal

The recovery factor used for this HARCO unheated sensor, model 102, was
 taken from the technical note that describes the wind-tunnel measurements
 of recovery factor for the similar Rosemount unheated sensor.
 The recovery factor is dependent on the Mach number, so the published graphs
 are represented by the following fit: 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0.988+0.053\log_{10}M+0.090\log_{10}M^{2}+0.091\log_{10}M^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 The probes are physically similar but not identical, but no similar study
 is available to characterize the recovery factor of the sensor being used.
 This recovery factor has been tested using flight legs that include speed
 changes in a region having apparently consistent temperature, and those
 tests are consistent with the fit being used.

A potentially more significant source of error, however, is the effect of
 measurements that for some reason are questionable or erroneous.
 As discussed above, such measurements were excluded where they were identified,

 To check on the effects of variations in the measurements entering the
 minimization, the sequence of measurements was split into five segments
 and fit coefficients were determined for each.
 The means of these fit coefficients were {0.37, 0.018} and when used individually
 to evaluate the adjustment needed in the full data set these fits indicated
 an adjustment of 0.30

\begin_layout Enumerate
Fortunately, there is a way to measure the horizontal pressure gradient
 because it will be reflected in the change in DVALUE.
 For example, in level flight the change in DVALUE will measure the pressure
 gradient; similarly, in a climb, the change in d-value can be compared
 to that expected for the measured temperature vs that of a standard atmosphere,
 so that also can be used as a measure of the pressure gradient.
 For horizontal or nearly horizontal motion (e.g., along pressure surfaces),
 
\begin_inset Formula $(dp/ds=-\rho g\, dH_{p}/ds$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the height at pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 The change 
\begin_inset Formula $dH_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the same as the change in d-value.
 The term needed to correct the pressure used in the hydrostatic equation
 is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{p}V\Delta T=-\rho gV\Delta T(dH_{p}/ds)=-\rho g\Delta H_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 In a climb, however, the same correction is not possible because a change
 caused by a horizontal pressure gradient can't be distinguished from one
 caused by a different temperature along the flight path.
 Even at 40,000 ft, though, the GV climbs at above 5 m/s, so the ratio of
 contributions from the horizontal and vertical gradients will be
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{-\rho g\Delta H_{p}}{-\rho g\Delta z}=\frac{V(dH_{p}/ds)}{W}\simeq40\frac{dH_{p}}{ds}
\]

\end_inset

For example, an upper limit to the horizontal height gradient might be 10
 m/100 km or <10
\begin_inset Formula $^{-4}$
\end_inset

; most level flight segments in the HIPPO flights show less than this gradient.
 In this case the vertical gradient would be changed by about 0.004, and
 a temperature change of around 1
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C would be required to produce the same change in the gradient.
 At this level of effect, it seems reasonable to expect that the measurements
 will tend to average toward the correct answer, especially if repeated
 climbs and descents are flown in the same direction so that the effects
 of the horizontal pressure gradient on climbs and descents tend to cancel.
 However, if all points including those from level legs are included, the
 trend that will be present in the horizontal gradient for flights that
 do not return to the starting base can easily be large enough to bias the
 deduced temperature by 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$
\end_inset

 or so.

 store values of ALTV at fixed pressures separated by 50 hPa, and store
 the locations (lat/long).
 Make a 2nd pass that uses the stored values to determine the pressure gradients
 as a function of time through the flight and adds these to the data files.

 Those two pressures are sufficient to determine the Mach number

 measured directly during a portion of a flight of the C-130.
 The variance is higher in the LAMS-determined temperature for the flight
 segment in the boundary layer (near 2100Z) because the flow conditions
 at the pitot tube and in the air sampled by LAMS tend to have lower coherence
 at high rate, leading to a noisier estimate of the temperature.

This new measurement of temperature is valuable as a check on the temperature
 sensors, because miscalibration or changes in the sensors will appear as
 a discrepancy in comparison to this measurement.
 However, temperature measurement by LAMS also has a very useful potential
 application in clouds, where backscatter from the cloud particles makes
 the LAMS signal very strong and where this measurement should continue
 to be valid.
 Measurement of temperature in cloud has been challenging because immersion
 sensors can become wet and, in the dynamically heated airflow, experience
 wet-bulb cooling to a variable extent dependent on the wetting (e.g.,

At this time, it is less certain how the system will perform in water clouds
 because almost all water clouds encountered with the LAMS have been supercooled

 More heating or data from warmer clouds will be needed to test the potential
 for measurements in water cloud.
 It is not yet clear that this will be a useful measurement because the
 backscattered return in dense cloud might be dominated by regions closer
 than the focal point of the system, where airflow distortion could be important.
 The change in the location of the sample volume of a laser system was recognize

 who recommended modified processing techniques selecting the peak rather
 than the mean in the Doppler-shifted wavelength spectrum, as used here,

 Indeed, too low a measurement of airspeed would cause the deduced temperature
 to be too low, as is the trend in this figure.

 Fits to the corrections deduced from this system, as functions of the measureme

 this level of accuracy even when the LAMS system is not available.
 Because the basis for the measurement is the Doppler shift in the frequency

 and because the measurement is made well ahead of the aircraft it is unaffected
 by flow distortion around the aircraft.

With accurate measurement of pressure, combined with excellent measurements

 on the temperature measurement from integrations of the hydrostatic equation
 during climbs and descents.
 For the GV, a dataset consisting of 122 extended climbs and descents, typically
 through >8

km, was used to determine that the measured temperature was within about
 0.3

 of the values required to minimize differences between calculated and true
 altitude changes.
 The correction required was a function of temperature but typically was
 +0.3
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.3\unit{\degree C}$
\end_inset

.
 This correction included all effects entering the measurement of ambient
 temperature at flight level, including corrections dependent on the recovery
 factor of the temperature probes, which are a significant source of uncertainty
 because of the large (often 25

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it was shown that the LAMS, combined with parametrized fits to
 correction factors for the measured dynamic and ambient pressure, can provide
 a measurement of temperature that is independent of any other temperature
 sensor.
 That measurement continues to be valid in all-ice clouds, but the limited
 measurements available in water clouds appear less satisfactory.
 The latter problem is not understood but is worth further investigation
 because most immersion sensors are affected by cloud water and produce
 erroneously low values in water clouds.

 That will extend the improvements available from LAMS to all three components

The effect of flow angle on measured total pressure from a pitot tube
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pitot tubes are designed to be insensitive to airflow conditions at small
 angles from their centrelines and are assumed to deliver the correct total
 pressure under such conditions.
 To check this, a flight segment with LAMS operational included yaw manoeuvres
 in which the aircraft was flown in conditions of small side-slip (<3

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$
\backslash
unit{
\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

) in cross-controlled conditions so that the aircraft continued in approximately
 the same direction and at approximately the same airspeed.
 Under those conditions, one would expect that the total pressure measured
 by the pitot tube would not show a dependence on side-slip angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because a high-accuracy test is desired, small corrections are needed for
 the observed departures from steady flight speed and in altitude.
 Over the course of the manoeuvre, GPS measurements of altitude were used
 with the hydrostatic equation to estimate and correct for changes in the
 ambient pressure using 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta p=-(p/R_{a}T)g\delta z$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta z$
\end_inset

 is the change in altitude from the start of the flight segment, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the ambient pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{a}$
\end_inset

 the gas constant for air, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 the absolute temperature, and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 the acceleration of gravity.
 In addition, a correction was made for the expected change in total pressure
 arising from small changes in airspeed, as measured by the LAMS\SpecialChar \@.
 This is
 an independent measurement of airspeed that does not rely on the aircraft
 measurements of ambient and dynamic pressure, so the correction is not
 affected by possible errors in the measurement of dynamic pressure.
 The correction applied is given by the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta q=\left(\frac{p}{R_{a}T}\left(\frac{v_{l}^{2}}{2c_{p}T}+1\right)^{\frac{c_{p}}{R_{a}}-1}v_{l}\right)\delta v_{l}\label{eq:CorrectionInSideslipFigure}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is obtained by differentiating (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:qFromLAMS-1"

\end_inset

).
 In this equation, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{l}$
\end_inset

 is the airspeed measured by LAMS and the increment is referenced to the
 arbitrary starting value in the time series so that corrections are made
 for the non-steady flight speed during the manoeuvres.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these corrections, the average total pressure measurements as a function
 of the magnitude of the side-slip angle are as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PtvsSSLIP"

\end_inset

.
 Within a limit of about 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa, there is no dependence on side-slip angle out to about 3

\end_layout

\end_inset

, a range in side-slip angles and also in attack angles from the mean that
 is characteristic of normal flight of both NCAR aircraft.
 This is justification for neglecting possible dependence of the total pressure
 measurement on flow angles, at least for the small angles characteristic
 of normal flight.

 relative to the right axis).
 It might be expected that the d-value would change smoothly, as suggested
 by the solid red line.

 Croix, Virgin Islands.
 Gaps in data show portions omitted because the LAMS signal was too weak
 to be reliable.

The total pressure (from the sum of the ambient pressure measurement and
 the dynamic pressure measurement) on the C-130 as a function of the magnitude
 of the side-slip angle during yaw manoeuvres in which sideslip angles were
 forced by rudder action while the aircraft continued on approximately a
 straight-and-level course.
 The mean total pressure of 760.6
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa has been subtracted from the measurements.
 Error bars are standard deviations in the measurements for the total-pressure
 axis and are the range of the bin used in sideslip.
 Corrections for deviations from a level course and for small variations
 in airspeed have been applied, as discussed in the text.
