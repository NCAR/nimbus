The cab file for your application has been built as 'C:\MTP\VB6\VBP\Misc\GH_UDP\Package\GH_UDP.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\MTP\VB6\VBP\Misc\GH_UDP\Package\Support\GH_UDP.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
