Translator to translate 2DS data from the 3V-CPI into the RAF OAP file format.
Decompress the data and repackages.

2D_compat_trans_v6.zip is the original code from SPEC.
  It produces two output files for every input file, splitting H & V into
  separate files.  We would prefer to have them integrated into a single
  file, and have all files from a directory in one file.
