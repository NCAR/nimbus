/* ************************************
Prometheus AD scan routine. Requires hardware level IO permission to be established by the calling program.
Unlike the DMM AD scan, the Prometheus has a FIFO that is used to store the entire series of channel conversions.
There is no need to trigger every conversion. nAverages allows to average several AD conversions.
Procedure (based on code from DiamondSystems):
	Fifo reset
	Set A/D low and high channel
	Set A/D mode and scan enable bit
	Check wait bit, wait until wait bit settles
	Start A/D conversion
	Check conversion status bit, wait until conversion completes
	For low channel to high channel
		Read LSB, MSB, and combine
