Steps to reprogram the GNI.  This assumes a .hex has been produced from the
Keil compiler.

1. Install the reset cable.  This is an RS-232 connector one end and a little
   black box with button on the other end.  Cable hooks to internal port in GNI.

2. Power on the GNI while reset button is depressed.  Release button soon after
   power on (perhaps 1 second).

3. Start hyperterminal
 - type in 5-6 capital U's.  These should echo back as U, if they are garbled,
   then it didn't get the baud rate correct, go back to step 2.
 - Quit hyperterminal

5. Start Flash Magic
 - Select Hex file (in middle of screen), it defaults to last file/path.
 - Press Start Programming, just below this.
 - Go to ISP menu -> Device Configuration
   - Uncheck 'Enable Debugger' and 'Enable Brownout'
   - Click Reprogram
 - Quit Flash Magic

6. Start hyperterminal

7. Cycle power on GNI.
