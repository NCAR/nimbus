     INTRODUCTION

          The BTI1553.H and libbti1553.so files are the C
          language header and shared library for the BTI1553
          Driver API.  The BTI1553 API library is dependent
          upon the BTICard API library.  Additionally, the RPC
          mode driver is dependent on the BTIRPC library.
          With these files, the user can write applications
          that operate a BTIDriver compliant MIL-STD-1553 device.

          The Driver API has been tested using GCC 3.3.1.

          The examples files are written in C and have been
          tested using GCC 3.3.1.



     MAKEFILE

          All the example programs can be made by simply
          running the 'make' command.

          To remove the built example programs, run the
          'make clean' command.



     BTI1553.H

          Applications written in the C language
          that use the BTI1553 Driver API library must
          incorporate the header file BTI1553.H using the
          #include preprocessor directive.  Assuming the
          header file is in the current working directory or
          in the INCLUDE path, the following line must be
          added to the top of the application's source file:

          #include "BTI1553.H"



     EXAMPLE PROGRAMS

          Examples are provided both in C source code files
          and the resultant executable format for the different
          architectures.



     FUNCTION OVERVIEW

          All functions are described in detail in the
          Ballard Technology MIL-STD-1553 API Reference Manual.



     CORRECTIONS, WARNINGS, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

          There is no additional information.
