# LAMS Processing: Construct relative wind components from the LAMS measurements

# <markdowncell>

# This routine reads a netCDF file with the normal data, to which Scott Spuler has added three variables that contain the measurements of airspeed from the three beams of 3D-LAMS. It adds three new variables to that file representing the three relative-wind components as measured by LAMS but translated back to the IRS reference system. These relative-wind components are analogous to the same measurements made by the radome gust system and can be used as alternate measurements of relative wind when constructing the true wind.
# 
# The processing sequence is as follows:                                                       
#   1. The conventional measurements are processed by nimbus and output to a netCDF file. That file has the measurements needed to determine the components of the relative wind from the radome gust probe, TASX, the IRS attitude angles, and the CMIGITS attitude angles.       
# 2. Scott uses TASX to determine folding and the histograms recorded by LAMS to determine three velocities, {VA, VB, VC}. which he adds to the netCDF file.   
# 3. This routine reads the reulting netCDF file for the components listed in step 1 and also for A={VA, VB, VC}. It then performs the transformations discussed in this note: 'LAMSprocessing3Dwind.pdf' on the RAF science wiki: http://wiki.eol.ucar.edu/rafscience/LAMS%20Processing?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=LAMSprocessing3Dwind.pdf . Some sections of that memo are reproduced below to indicate how they relate to the segments of the code that follow.

# RWT is now the relative wind in the earth reference frame, but still with {x,y,z} {north, east, down}.

# corresponding velocity components of the aircraft, {VNSC, VEWC, VSPD}. Subtraction is needed
# because wind is characterized by the direction ${\bf from\ which}$ the wind blows, while the
# aircraft motion is characterized by motion toward the corresponding direction. Subtracting the
# aircraft velocity then gives
