This processing code was used to generate quick-look data for CONTRAST.
Interpolate.m is a function that is called from other code and is not run
directly. To run the code:

1) Modify flight_constants.m to contain the flight number, date, and filter
thresholds for the flight you are processing.
2) Run IFPall.m to load the PICARRO Private data (.h5) and aircraft .nc
files and write them out as .mat files.
3) Run combine_CO_PICARRO_DATA to read in the .mat files just written out
and do the quick-look processing.
4) Run write_ICARTT.m to write the final data out in ICARTT format.

Plots are created throughout the process. As you proceed, review the plots
and make changes to the filter thresholds as necessary, then rerun with the
new thresholds and repeat.
