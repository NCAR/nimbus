// SB: jpeg code example from Chris W. with some small modifications, primarily in variable names. 
/*
 * example.c
 *
 * This file illustrates how to use the IJG code as a subroutine library
 * to read or write JPEG image files.  You should look at this code in
 * conjunction with the documentation file libjpeg.doc.
 *
 * This code will not do anything useful as-is, but it may be helpful as a
 * skeleton for constructing routines that call the JPEG library.
 *
 * We present these routines in the same coding style used in the JPEG code
 * (ANSI function definitions, etc); but you are of course free to code your
 * routines in a different style if you prefer.
 */

/*
 * Include file for users of JPEG library.
 * You will need to have included system headers that define at least
 * the typedefs FILE and size_t before you can include jpeglib.h.
 * (stdio.h is sufficient on ANSI-conforming systems.)
 * You may also wish to include "jerror.h".
 */

#include <jpeglib.h>

/*
 * <setjmp.h> is used for the optional error recovery mechanism shown in
 * the second part of the example.

/******************** JPEG COMPRESSION SAMPLE INTERFACE *******************/

/* This half of the example shows how to feed data into the JPEG compressor.
 * We present a minimal version that does not worry about refinements such
 * as error recovery (the JPEG code will just exit() if it gets an error).
 */


/*
 * IMAGE DATA FORMATS:
 *
 * The standard input image format is a rectangular array of pixels, with
 * each pixel having the same number of "component" values (color channels).
 * Each pixel row is an array of JSAMPLEs (which typically are unsigned chars).
 * If you are working with color data, then the color values for each pixel
 * must be adjacent in the row; for example, R,G,B,R,G,B,R,G,B,... for 24-bit
 * RGB color.
 *
 * For this example, we'll assume that this data structure matches the way
 * our application has stored the image in memory, so we can just pass a
 * pointer to our image buffer.  In particular, let's say that the image is
 * RGB color and is described by:
 */

// extern JSAMPLE * image_buffer;	/* Points to large array of R,G,B-order data */
// extern int image_height;	/* Number of rows in image */	SB: Use camera.frame_height
// extern int image_width;	/* Number of col's in image */  SB: Use camera.frame_width


/*
 * Sample routine for JPEG compression.  We assume that the target file name
 * and a compression quality factor are passed in.

   * compression/decompression processes, in existence at once.  We refer
   * to any one struct (and its associated working data) as a "JPEG object".
   */
  struct jpeg_compress_struct cinfo;
  /* This struct represents a JPEG error handler.  It is declared separately

   * take the easy way out and use the standard error handler, which will
   * print a message on stderr and call exit() if compression fails.
   * Note that this struct must live as long as the main JPEG parameter
   * struct, to avoid dangling-pointer problems.

//  cinfo.in_color_space = JCS_GRAYSCALE;	// SB: monochrome images.

  /* Now use the library's routine to set default compression parameters.

   * Pass TRUE unless you are very sure of what you're doing.
   */

  /* Step 5: while (scan lines remain to be written) */
  /*           jpeg_write_scanlines(...); */

  /* Here we use the library's state variable cinfo.next_scanline as the
   * loop counter, so that we don't have to keep track ourselves.
   * To keep things simple, we pass one scanline per call; you can pass
   * more if you wish, though.

}


/*
 * SOME FINE POINTS:
 *
 * In the above loop, we ignored the return value of jpeg_write_scanlines,
 * which is the number of scanlines actually written.  We could get away
 * with this because we were only relying on the value of cinfo.next_scanline,
 * which will be incremented correctly.  If you maintain additional loop
 * variables then you should be careful to increment them properly.
 * Actually, for output to a stdio stream you needn't worry, because
 * then jpeg_write_scanlines will write all the lines passed (or else exit
 * with a fatal error).  Partial writes can only occur if you use a data
 * destination module that can demand suspension of the compressor.
 * (If you don't know what that's for, you don't need it.)
 *
 * If the compressor requires full-image buffers (for entropy-coding
 * optimization or a multi-scan JPEG file), it will create temporary
 * files for anything that doesn't fit within the maximum-memory setting.
 * (Note that temp files are NOT needed if you use the default parameters.)
 * On some systems you may need to set up a signal handler to ensure that
 * temporary files are deleted if the program is interrupted.  See libjpeg.doc.
 *
 * Scanlines MUST be supplied in top-to-bottom order if you want your JPEG
 * files to be compatible with everyone else's.  If you cannot readily read
 * your data in that order, you'll need an intermediate array to hold the
 * image.  See rdtarga.c or rdbmp.c for examples of handling bottom-to-top
 * source data using the JPEG code's internal virtual-array mechanisms.
