These example programs are written for use with the libdc1394 library
available at www.sourceforge.net.

These example programs are not meant to be just compiled and run.  The 
source contains near the top of the file a configuration definition section
that should be edited by each user to conform to their particular setup,
before it is compiled.

The files "conversions.h" and "conversions.cpp" originate from the
coriander project, which is an excellent IIDC camera GUI that also works
with the libdc1394 library.  These files provide functionality to convert
bayer tile pattern images to color images.
