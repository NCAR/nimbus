%description
This program finds any cameras on the Firewire (ieee1394) bus and attempts to capture images from them. The program can output raw CCD data, uncompressed color images (.ppm), lossy compressed imges (.jpg) or lossess compressed images (.png). The Program also keeps a Post- greSQL database up to date with the latest image written, as well as the direction/guid of each camera, and process status (running/not).

%changelog
* Sun Jun 2 2013 <tbaltzer@ucar.edu> 1.0-2
- Needed to have add .sh to /etc/init.d/capture so that when restarting and checking for /usr/bin/capture, 
-     we don't accidently find ourself and think that capture is still running
- Also fixed bug for test being for capture_monitor, since it was already running in a restart instance
-     I'm not sure if this ever worked.

* Fri Mar 23 2012 <tbaltzer@ucar.edu> 0.7-1
- cjw changed capture stop/start to unload and reload firewire modules
-    this is the reload_fw program (source unfound - use strings reload_fw to see what it does)
- updated capture for /etc/init.d to provide more information to user through syslog
- added a make clean in case .o files exist prior to make
- no longer requires libpqxx libraries
