To Be Done
----------

- Modify movie.pl and combineCameras.pl to name the output mp4 
fltno.[FWD|DOWN|FWD_DOWN].YYYYMMDD.hhmmss_hhmmss.mp4 
instead of fltno.mp4

-Last time I ran combineCameras.pl, it died creating the last annotated image with the error:

Use of uninitialized value in substr at ./combineCameras.pl line 336.
substr outside of string at ./combineCameras.pl line 336.
Use of uninitialized value in string ne at ./combineCameras.pl line 336.
End of data file reached searching for c130_fwd_081111_214500.jpg at ./combineCameras.pl line 340.
