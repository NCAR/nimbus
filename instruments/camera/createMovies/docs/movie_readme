VOCALS digital camera notes

The forward-facing camera is located in the cockpit. It is an AXIS network 
camera - Color, 704x480 resolution. The xxxx
lens has a focal length of xxx mm. The field of view is about 67 x 53 degrees.

The downward-facing camera is located on the bottom of the body of the plane. 
It is a Point Grey Research Hi-Res Flea - Color, 1024x768 resolution. The 
Navitar DO-412 lens has a focal length of 4 mm. The field of view is about 
62 x 48 degrees with some barrel distortion.

Images were acquired once per second and stored as JPEG-compressed files,
roughly 50 kB each. No processing of the images was performed beyond
converting the raw pixel signal into a 24 bit color image. Applying a
sharpening filter as is ordinarily done by consumer digital cameras will
considerably improve the appearance. The UTC date and time are encoded in
the filename as YYMMDD-HHMMSS.jpg. These are the archived images.

For the preliminary MPEG-4 movies each image was processed with the linux
ImageMagick toolkit. The image was first cropped to 512x384 pixels.
Sharpening was then performed [SHARPEN(0.0x1.0)]. Where both forward- and
downward-looking camera images are avilable, the images were combined into
a single frame. Each image was then annotated in the lower right with the 
time the image was recorded and data values at the image time for a set of 
data paramters chosen by RAF. These 1-second annotated images were compiled 
into a video stream running at 15 frames/s, 1000 k bps data rate.

The movies can be played by Quicktime 7 or later (Mac and Windows), xine
(linux) and mplayer (multiplatform, not tested).

Flight comments:
RF01: Camera ceased recording images at about 20:58:09
RF07: Only forward-looking camera is available.
RF08: Only forward-looking camera is available.
