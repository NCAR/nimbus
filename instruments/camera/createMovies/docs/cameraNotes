Cameras:
	C130 forward: AXIS network camera.
		This could be changed out for a 'FLEA' (see below) in the future.
		704x480 pixels, rectangular, equivalent to 640c480 square pixels.
		Images have date and time stamped on them.
		images name: c130_fwd_YYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg (May want to change '_' to '-' in future).

	C130 down, GV forward
		Point Grey color FLEA.
		Powered only during flight
		1024x768 square pixels.
		image name: YYMMDD-HHMMSS.jpg
		Directory: YYMMDD-HHMMSS for time when camera DSM was powered on, typically 1/2 hour pre-flight.

Post-flight:
	Back up images.
		delete nighttime images.
		delete C130 images taken prior to takeoff, after landing, in hanger, etc.

	Generate preliminary movies
		Axis camera
			No adjustments are necessary.
			Reducing resolution is optional.
			Create movie with Quicktime or ffmpeg.

		Flea camera
			Run moviePrelim.pl to sharpen, rescale, & timestamp images.
			Create movie with quicktime or ffmpeg.

Post-project
	Send image to mass store.
	Determine desired annotation variables and set up parameters file.
	Generate final movies
		Run movie.pl for single camera, combineCameras.pl for two cameras.
		Generate movies with Quicktime or in movie.pl with ffmpeg.
	Produce README file.
	Optional - Convert Axis images to 640x480 for square pixels,
	Optional - Apply sharpening, possibly reduce resolution for Flea images.
	Archive

Movie parameters
	The H.264 codec is the best I've seen for quality and size and is widely supported.
	Presumably ffmpeg supports this codec but I don't think our installation currently does.
	Quicktime supports H.264.

	Final H & V resolutions should be a multiple of 16.
	Typical bit rate is 1000 - 1500 Mb/s. Downward images might need more - faster scene change.
