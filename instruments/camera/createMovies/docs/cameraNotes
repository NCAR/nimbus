RAF Aircraft Camera Image processing notes
==========================================

Cameras
-------

Currently (as of Jan 28, 2010) there are two camera types used at the RAF.

1) AXIS network camera
	
Used as the C130 forward-pointing camera.
This could be changed out for a 'FLEA' (see below) in the future.
704x480 pixels, rectangular, equivalent to 640c480 square pixels.
Images have date and time stamped on them.
images name: c130_fwd_YYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg 
	(May want to change '_' to '-' in future).



2) Point Grey color FLEA.

Used as the C130 down, GV forward, GV left, GV right
Powered only during flight
1024x768 square pixels.
image name: YYMMDD-HHMMSS.jpg
Directory: YYMMDD-HHMMSS from time when camera DSM was powered on, 
	typically 1/2 hour pre-flight.


Processing tasks
----------------

Post-flight:
	Back up images.
	delete nighttime images.
	delete C130 images taken prior to takeoff, after landing, in hanger, etc

	Generate preliminary movies:

	-Axis camera
		No adjustments are necessary.
		Reducing resolution is optional.
		Create movie with Quicktime or ffmpeg.

	-Flea camera
		Run moviePrelim.pl to sharpen, rescale, & timestamp images.
		Create movie with quicktime or ffmpeg.

Post-project:
	Send image to mass store.
	Determine desired annotation variables and set up parameters file.

	Generate final movies
		Create ParamFile for this project.
		Run combineCameras.pl to generate movies with ffmpeg.
		(Possibly use Quicktime in the future)

	Produce README file.
	Optional - Convert Axis images to 640x480 for square pixels,
	Optional - Apply sharpening, possibly reduce resolution for Flea images.
	Archive

Movie parameters
	The H.264 codec is the best I've seen for quality and size and is 
	widely supported.  Presumably ffmpeg supports this codec but I don't 
	think our installation currently does.
	Quicktime supports H.264.

	Final H & V resolutions should be a multiple of 16.
	Typical bit rate is 1000 - 1500 Mb/s. Downward images might need more 
	- faster scene change.
