/// The application which manages communications between one or more

/// There are two types of switch: one which communicates with
/// the proxies via SSL, and the other which embeds local
/// proxies within the Switch.
///
/// A SwitchConection manages the connection between the two switches.
///
/// All messages which are transferred between the proxies and the switch
/// connection come through the Switch, so that rate limiting and
/// message filtering can be centrally managed. This is handled in
/// msgFromProxySlot() and msgFromRemoteSwitch().
///
/// Within the switch is a ProxyServer, which manages the connections between the
/// proxies and the switch. It is a server because it can dynamically
/// create connections for proxies. There are two flavors of ProxyServer: the
/// SslProxyServer for handling remote SSL proxies, and the EmbeddedProxyServer
/// for the local embedded proxies.
