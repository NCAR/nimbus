**Select Module:**

A 'track' is a complete flight plan. It consists of a set of 'modules',
selected here, that may be single enroute tracks or multiple passes
as in a vertical section. Select the module here that you want to use
for the module number displayed behind '#' to the right, then use the
entries in the blue panel to specify characteristics for that module.
For additional help on those characteristics, click on the gray
'Other' button in that panel. When the module characteristics are
defined, click on the light-red 'Add module to track' button below
this item to add it to the track and advance to the next module.
----- 
**Add module to track:**

Once a module is defined by selecting its type (above) and specifying
its characteristics (in the blue panel to the right), it should be
added to the track using this button. If a module with the displayed
module number ('#') already exists, it will be overwritten; this makes
it possible to edit an existing module by selecting it by number,
changing any of the displayed characteristics (including the module
type), and then saving it via this button. (The button is light
red to indicate that it usually must be used when defining a track;
white buttons are optional.)  
----- 
**Show current track:**

Click this button to see the current definition of the full track
in terms of modules and module characteristics. The track will
be displayed in a new window, with options to print and save the
listing. The display also shows the flight time required and the fuel
remaining for research at the end of each module.  
----- 
**Backup and make kml:**

Once a track is fully defined, use this button to make the appropriate
kml-format file that is suitable for displaying the track in Google
Earth or Open Street Maps displays. The saved file is named 'Plan.kml'
so if you want to save different .kml files you will need to rename
it. A backup of the track is also saved in a file always named
'Backup.track'. This is just for emergency recovery; you should save
tracks you want to save using the 'Save' menu item in the 'File' menu.
A recommended convention is to save these with names like 'Plan.xxx'
where 'xxx' might be a date or research flight number. (The button is
colored light red to indicate that is usually must be used because
generating a .kml file is normally required to see the flight track
on the Mission Coordinator display. In contrast, buttons that are
white are optional.)  
----- 
**Show in Google Earth:**

On linux machines, this button will start Google Earth with the plan 
(Plan.kml) as defined here. On the GV, this button instead transfers
PlanAC.kml to become the planned-track display on the Mission Coordinator
display. 

The Google Earth start-up is not yet implemented for operating
systems other than linux.
----- 
**deg min format:**

Entries for latitude and longitude can be entered in either integer
degrees and decimal minutes (i.e., 39 56.7) or in decimal degrees
(i.e., 39.945). Check this box to use the former, and uncheck it to
use the latter. Whenever this check box is toggled, the displayed
coordinates will be converted between the two formats, so this also
provides a quick converter. Note that the flight crew will normally
want the former format, in integer degrees and not more than one
fractional digit for the decimal minute (as in 56.7).  
----- 
**Spin Control:**
This control determines the module number to display in this right-side
window. You can either increment/decrement using the arrow buttons or
enter a number and press return. On some Windows systems, there have
been problems with this button: A fall-back is to tab through the display
items (7 tabs from the starting location) to select the spin control item
and then use the up/down arrows to change it.
-----
**Size, n mi:**

If the module has a characteristic size, enter it here in units of
nautical miles. Some module types do not need a size specification
(e.g., ReturnToBase), so in those cases this entry line is replaced
by 'NA' or 'None'. In that case, it is not necessary to specify a
size. Some additional hints regarding the meaning of this size for
each module type can be seen by clicking the gray 'Other' button at
the bottom left corner of this blue panel.  
----- 
**Anchor (lat, lon, alt) [deg,min, deg,min, ft]:**

The anchor point for a module is the reference point from which legs
that constitute the module start. When the flight track is generated,
a first segment will connect the current aircraft location just
prior to the start of this module to this anchor point, so it is not
necessary to specify an 'Enroute' module to this starting point unless
it is desirable to take a route that is different from the direct
route. The anchor point is specified in terms of the starting latitude,
longitude and altitude (in the format specified by the 'deg min format'
check box for latitude and longitude, and in pressure altitude in
feet for the altitude entry. If the aircraft is not already at this
altitude, the first leg to this anchor point will include a climb
to this altitude.  It is best to specify altitudes in increments
that correspond to flight levels (e.g., 29000 ft to correspond to
FL290); attempts to enter altitudes with higher resolution than 100
ft, except for the airport altitude, will be rounded to the nearest
100 ft. Use negative numbers for south latitude or west longitude,
but use positive minutes in all cases except when the degree entry
is zero; then use negative minutes for the minutes entry (e.g.,
(0 -15.0) for a latitude just south of the equator, but (0 15.0)
for one just north of the equator).  
----- 
**Angle:**

When the module has an orientation, as for example for a
VerticalSection or the first leg of a Lawnmower pattern, this
entry gives that orientation in terms of degrees relative to true
North. Magnetic declination is not included here but would be needed
if the flight crew needed to fly in a specific direction instead of
toward a specific waypoint.  
----- 
**Legs:**

For patterns consisting of repeated legs, as for example in the
case of a VerticalSection, this entry specifies the number of legs
to be included. Use an even number to end on the same side as that
where the pattern starts. Between legs, there will be some change,
for example in altitude; this is specified in the module-dependent
'Other' entry. See the gray 'Other' button for more information on
the increments between legs.  
----- 
**Other Button:***

Click on this button to activate a display that provides additional
help on the meaning of the entry line to the right of the button,
which defines a module-dependent characteristic that varies among
modules. If the entry to the right is 'NA' or 'None' for a particular
module type, this characteristic is not needed and should not be
defined for that module type.  
----- 
**Other:**

The entry shown to the right of the 'Other' button is an additional
characteristic that depends on the module type. For example, it
is the altitude increment (possibly negative) between legs for a
VerticalSection, and it is the horizontal offset between legs for
a Lawnmower patters (where a positive value indicates a turn to the
right at the end of the first leg). Click on the gray 'Other' button
for more information on the meaning of this entry for various module
types. If the entry shows 'NA' or 'None' it is not needed for the
specified module type.  
----- 
**Drifting:**

If the 'Drifting' check box is checked, the module will be generated
as a series of waypoints that drift with the wind at the flight
altitude as the pattern is flown. A single value of the wind for a
given altitude is used. This permits definition of tracks that follow
approximately Lagrangian-drifting locations in the atmosphere. In
such cases, it may be preferable to activate the GV 'pointer' during
the first leg and refine the locations on the basis of that pointer,
but using the 'Drifting' feature still permits flight planning that
gives approximate locations and times for the flight segments. If the
flight crew flies between waypoints as defined using the appropriate
ground tracks, the flight pattern will compensate for the wind (if
it is appropriately represented in the sounding) in the right way to
produce Lagrangian tracking. Beware of possible exhaust contamination
if patterns are flown without displacement between legs because using
this feature in such cases will attempt to place the aircraft exactly
along the same drifting track each leg.  
-----
**Load Nearby:**

When this button is clicked, the program will read the lat/lon from
the Main Window (NOTE: NOT from this Navigation window) and will
then search the VOR and Waypoint (WPT) databases for navigation
points closest to the specified lat/lon. The closest four VORs and
closest four waypoints will be added to the navigation points that
are displayed here. A file named Nearest.out will also be written
to the directory containing this program; that lists the points in
order starting with the closest, and shows the distance to the
points. After the points are added, the full list is alphabetized,
so it is sometimes necessary to search for the added points.
-----
**Clear All:**

This button will remove all the navigation points except the RAF
home location. This action cannot be undone, but it is possible
to return to a saved set of points by loading them from the NavPts
menu item 'Open'.
-----
**Add Button:**

Use this button to add the specified navigation point (as defined
by the entries to the right) to the Navigation Points. 
-----
**Find Button:**

For a specified VOR or navigation point, this button searches the
database and, if a match is found, loads the lat/lon coordinates of
the specified point. For example, to find CYS, enter CYS in the entry
box just to the right of the 'Add' button, then click 'Find' to see
the lat/lon of the CYS VOR. The point can then be added to the points
displayed via the 'Add' button.
-----
**Left Button and Remove Button:**

The button to the left of each entry, labeled with the name of the
VOR or waypoint, will transfer the lat/lon coordinates to the main
'PlanFlight' window. The displayed navigation points can be used 
as reference coordinates for defining tracks in this way.

The 'Remove' button erases the associated navigation point from the
display. There is no mechanism for undoing this removal except by
adding the point again using the 'Add' or 'Load Nearby' buttons.
