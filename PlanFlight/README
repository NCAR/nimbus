To run the PlanTrack program, copy this directory to your workspace, then run
using './PlanTrack.py [Plan.xxx]' where the argument in brackets is optional
but will load the specified track if it is given.

This program requires python 2.6 or later, and it requires the wxPython package 
also. Both are available on tikal.eol.ucar.edu, so the program will run there.
Python and wxPython are available for many platforms including Windows and
Mac as well as linux. The reason that Python 2.6+ is required is that the
'format' command is used extensively and that was not available in earlier
versions of python. In addition, the package matplotlib is used to generate
some of the (optional) plots, and to use it with wxpython you will need the
wxPython 'backend' for python-matplotlib (named python-matplotlib-wx-xxxx) --
or maybe the WXAgg backend will work? Both work on tikal. If it is not already
present you will need numpy, also available from sourceforge.net. Note that
you may need version 1.5.1 to be compatible with Python 2.7; strangely,
1.6.1 seems only to be compatible with Python 2.6.

The coordinates included in the subdirectory 'NavPoints' are a subset of
what is available. More points can be generated easily from the full database
but are not included here.

The 'Map' menu includes only one map. More can be generated and added to the
menu; see 'Xform.py' for an aid to determining the transformation from cursor
coordinates to lat/lon as is needed for maps in this format.

The button that starts Google Earth with the .kml file produced by this
program works with linux if google-earth is in the path. For Windows, another
solution is needed.

I was able to get this to work on a 32-bit Windows machine as follows:
  1. Download and install 
     http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/python-2.7.1.msi
  2. Download and install
     http://downloads.source.forge.net/
            wxpython/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.12.1-py27.exe
  3. Copy the directory PlanFlight to the windows machine
  4. Create link on the desktop to PlanFlight.py in the directory
  5. Double-click on that link.
It may be necessary to change PlanFlight.py permissions on a linux source 
directory to remove executable permission (i.e., chmod -x PlanFlight.py)
before copying, to see the file. Change them back afterward or the file
won't execute on the linux machine.

The 'Help.txt' file includes additional information on using the program and
on some details or problems with the approach taken.

These files are not used and should be deleted from the archive:
  Sounding.py
  Cursor.py
  Example*.py
They were used for study prior to incorporating the code into PlanFlight.py.
