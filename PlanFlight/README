To run the PlanTrack program, copy this directory to your workspace, then run
using './PlanTrack.py [Plan.xxx]' where the argument in brackets is optional
but will load the specified track if it is given.

This program requires:
  *  python 2.6 or later
  *  wxPython package 
  *  matplotlib (for some plots; a version without those plots is available)
  *  numpy (required by matplotlib)
All are available on tikal.eol.ucar.edu, so the program will run there.
Python and wxPython are available for many platforms including Windows and
Mac as well as linux; see below for suggested sources. The reason that Python 
2.6+ is required is that the 'format' command is used extensively and that 
was not available in earlier versions of python. The package matplotlib is 
a Matlab-like package used to generate some of the (optional) plots.

The coordinates included in the subdirectory 'NavPoints' are a subset of
what is available. More points can be generated easily from the full database
but are not included here. Contact: Al Cooper (cooperw@ucar.edu)

The 'Map' menu includes only one map. More can be generated and added to the
menu; see 'Xform.py' for an aid to determining the transformation from cursor
coordinates to lat/lon as is needed for maps in this format.

The button that starts Google Earth with the .kml file produced by this
program works with linux if google-earth is in the path. For Windows, another
solution is needed.

I was able to get this to work on a 32-bit Windows machine as follows.
(This is probably the safest route to a working version on a 64-bit
machine also, although that hasn't been explored as much as the
32-bit version.)
  1. Download and install python:
     http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi
     Don't use python-3; that will probably not work.
  2. Download and install wxPython (used by the PlanFlight GUI):
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/2.8.12.1/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.12.1-py27.exe/download
     Be sure to match the Python version; see 'py27' above.
     (accept option to prepare tools at end of install)
  3. Download and install matplotlib:
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.1.0/matplotlib-1.1.0.win32-py2.7.exe/download
     Again, it is important to match the python version (py2.7)
  4. Download and install numpy:
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.6.1/numpy-1.6.1-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe/download
     Ditto re Python version.
  5. Copy the directory PlanFlight to the windows machine. On EOL machines,
     this is accessible via ~cooperw/PlanFlight; it is also saved as
     ftp://ftp.eol.ucar.edu/pub/temp/users/cooperw/PlanFlightxx.tgz
     where xx is the date of the version. It is also available in the
     EOL SVN repository.
  6. Create link on the desktop to PlanFlight.py in the above directory
  7. Double-click on that link.

It may be necessary to change PlanFlight.py permissions on a linux source 
directory to remove executable permission (i.e., chmod -x PlanFlight.py)
before copying, to see the file. Change them back afterward or the file
won't execute on the linux machine.

The 'Help.txt' file includes additional information on using the program and
on some details or problems with the approach taken.

These files are not used and should be deleted from the archive:
  Sounding.py
  Cursor.py
  Example*.py
They were used for study prior to incorporating the code into PlanFlight.py.
