See 'Overview.lyx / Overview.pdf' for description of these files. The standard directory for 'PlanFlight' does not include all the .xml files from which the coordiates are extracted; these are in another directory, because they are about 50 MB. The files VOR.txt and WPTS.txt are read directly by 'PlanFlight.py' in the parent directory. Special versions of 'ReviseCoordinates.pl' and 'Nearest.pl', originally in this directory, have been moved to the parent directory.
