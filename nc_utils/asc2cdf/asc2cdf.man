.SH NAME
asc2cdf \- ASCII to netCDF converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
asc2cdf [-b time_t] [-a] [-l] [-m] [-r n] [-s n] ASCII_file netCDF_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B asc2cdf 
is program for uploading ASCII data into a netCDF file that follows the
NCAR-RAF/nimbus conventions.  Files that are then useable by ncplot and
the suite of nc* programs at RAF.  With no options, asc2cdf expects the
file to look like something produced by n2asc.  A top row with variable
names, and time in the HH:MM:SS format in the left column.
.PP
The -a option tells asc2cdf that the input file will be following the NASA
Data Exchange Format (Ames).
.PP
The -l option tells asc2cdf that the input file will be following the NASA
Data Exchange Format (Langley).
.PP
The -b option defines a base_time in Unix seconds since January 1st 1970. 
This is useful when trying to merge data back into a netCDF file, where
ncmerge(1) complains about no overlapping time segments.  The default value
is 0.  This option has no affect when the -a or -l option is enabled.
.PP
The -r option defines the data rate.  Where the rate must be less than 1 Hz.
n = 5 means 1 sample every 5 seconds.  The default is 1.
.PP
The -s option tells asc2cdf to skip 'n' lines before getting to the data.
This option is ignored if -a or -l option has been specified.  The default is 1.
.PP
The -m option tells asc2cdf that time in the left column will be in
seconds since midnight format (with rounding).  This is automatically
turned on with the -a or -l option.
