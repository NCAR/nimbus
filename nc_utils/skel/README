1)	All editing should be done in amlib.c, unless you are doing something
	special.  There are 4 steps to complete which are labeled throughout
	amlib.c (they are not in order).

	If you need "one time" code to execute, the function Initialize() in
	init.c is a good choice, this will be before the header has been read
	from the input file.  If you need one time code executed after the
	header has been read from the input file, you can put it at the bottom
	of ReadInputFile() in netcdf.c.

	When editing these files, keep in mind that I wrote this code with
	tabstops set to 4 not 8.  Typing the command ":set ts=4" after
	entering vi will work.  You may also edit the file '.exrc' in your
	skel directory and put the command "set tabstop=4" into it.

2)	type 'make'

3)	To run it type, 'skel'

4)	After you have debugged it, you may edit the Makefile, and change the
	'-g' option to '-O' for faster performance.  After editing Makefile,
	type:

	make clean
	make
