<dt>NAME
<dd>g2n - GENPRO-to-netCDF conversion utility
</p>
<p>
<dt>SYNOPSIS
<dd>g2n [GENPRO_file netCDF_file [time_flag]]
</p>
<p>
<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>g2n 
is a program to convert a GENPRO-II output data file to a netCDF file which
conforms to the
<a href="netCDF.html">NCAR-RAF netCDF conventions</a>.
g2n accepts three optional
input arguments:  the input and output file names and a time flag.  If only
the input file name is provided on the command line, g2n will query the
user for all the information.  If both file names are entered on the command
line, environment variables, such as $MIGS can be used.  If g2n asks for them,
one must enter relative or absolute path names.  The time flag, if set, will
output (to stdout) a continuous update of the time being processed.  On the
command line, any argument entered after the two file names tells g2n to
output continuous time; otherwise g2n assumes that no time is to be output.
</p>
<p>
Using the &lt;control-C&gt; interrupt will stop the conversion and close the
netCDF file with a partial time period.
</p>
<p>
The input GENPRO-II file can have the original header file and data file
merged into one UNIX binary file, or it can be a COS-blocked file--the format
used by GENPRO-II data sets archived on the SCD Mass Store System (MSS).
</p>
<p>
Local NCAR users only:  If retrieving a GENPRO-II bitfile from the MSS, one
can use either of the RAF scripts &quot;msget&quot; or &quot;msgetgen.&quot;
If using the standard MIGS &quot;nrnet msget&quot; command, you may specify
either the local &quot;df=tr&quot; option (the default) or the local
&quot;df=bi&quot; option (which will strip off the COS-blocking).
</p>
<p>
One known limitation with GENPRO-II data sets is the lack of time zone
information.  g2n assumes that the data were taken using UTC.  Some data
sets used local time, and other documentation may be required to obtain
the actual times.
</p>
<p>
g2n converts all the data from all the variables in a GENPRO-II file to
netCDF at their respective rates.  It can translate the three known NCAR RAF
GENPRO-II formats that have been used since 1983.  g2n also can translate
at least two known University of Wyoming GENPRO-II formats and one NOAA Twin
Otter format.  Other GENPRO format variants may be added later.  The present
version of g2n is 2.7 (17 March 2004).
</p>
<p>
g2n now changes an original RAF GENPRO-II PMS-1D variable name (accumulation
and concentration), if present, to one which conforms to the NIMBUS naming
conventions.  (Unfortunately,the the PMS-1D plotting software, ncpp, needs
an upgrade to recognize it).  g2n substitutes a standard prefix name and
appends an index number suffix which mimics the currently-used probe-naming
format.  g2n also adds only the probe's suffix to all of a probe's Associated
Variable names (e.g., PLWCF).  (Any PMS-1D variable's long_name attribute is
not changed.)
</p>
<p>
Special changes to some GENPRO-II variable descriptions are needed for an
FSSP-100 probe so they conform to the current NIMBUS standards.  g2n
substitutes a probe's Associated Variable name for range (e.g., FRANGE) with
the standard name (FRNG).  And since GENPRO-II's range has values between
1 and 4 while FRNG has values between 0 and 3, the scale factor for FRNG is
now changed so g2n can decode the new values.
</p>
<p>
While g2n is running, output messages can be informational, a warning or
fatal.  An example informational message tells the user how many GENPRO-II
variables are in the data set.  Warnings usually point out inconsistencies
while reading the header or non-critical, missing header information.
Most fatal messages are caused by g2n's inability to read the GENPRO-II header
correctly.  Only fatal messages will quit the program without translating
the data.
</p>
<p>
<dt>ASSUMPTIONS
<dd>g2n assumes that only one time period exists in the GENPRO-II data set.
If this is not the case, results are unpredictable.
</p>
<p>
g2n was written under Sun Solaris and, in March 2004, has been ported to
Linux under Red Hat 9.  (It may also work with other versions).
</p>
<p>
<dt>KNOWN PROBLEMS
<dd>Using &lt;control-C&gt; to quit the program can occasionally leave the
output netCDF file unusable.
</p>
<p>
g2n has no &quot;automatic&quot; functions.  For example, g2n will not add a
&quot;.nc&quot; extension to a netCDF output data file, nor will it put the
output file in a predefined directory path using the $DATA_DIR environment
variable.  The user must specify those attributes.
</p>
<p>
g2n may not correctly interpret PMS-1D variables according to the
<a href="netCDF.html">NCAR-RAF netCDF conventions</a>
if their variable names have not been defined within the program.
(Name needs to be added to struct &quot;pms1d_std&quot; in &quot;g2n.h&quot;
and the program recompiled.)
</p>
<p>
g2n will not properly handle FSSP-100 range rescaling if the data file uses
the Wyoming IEEE format variant.
</p>
<p>
g2n cannot properly decode PMS-1D variables in any of U Wyoming data sets.
</p>
<p>
GENPRO format variations not known to g2n may cause it to fail.  (For example,
g2n cannot convert GENPRO-I data files.)
