  S ALL OR PART OF TIME PERIOD 16 20 40 TO 21 19 38  DESCRIPTION OF RECORD -- 116 PARAMETERS WERE SAVE
  D AT THEIR RESPECTIVE RATES.  THIS REPRESENTS  749 SAMPLES/PROGRAM CYCLE WHERE A CYCLE IS 1.000 SEC
   THE  2 CYCLES OF 749 SAMP/CYC = 1498 WERE THEN SCALED INTO 20 BIT INTEGERS AND PACKED 3 SAMPLES/WOR
  D INTO 500 60 BIT PACKED WORDS          --METHOD OF SCALING--  A BIAS AD(I) WAS ADDED TO EACH SAMPLE
   OF EACH PARAMETER  TO ELIMINATE ANY NEGATIVE VALUES. THE BIASED SAMPLE WAS THEN MULTIPLIED BY P(I)
  TO INSURE THE PROPER NUMBER OF DECIMAL PLACES WERE SAVED.  THE PACKED RECORD MAY BE UNPACKED BY RIGH
  T JUSTIFYING 20 BITS AT A TIME AND REVERSING THE ABOVE SCALING PROCESS. AS EXAMPLE, S(I)=N/P(I)-AD(I
  ), WHERE N IS THE 20 BIT SCALED INTEGER, S(I) THE DESIRED UNSCALED PARAMETER, AD(I),P(I) THE CORRESP
  ONDING SCALE FACTORS  THE ORDER, RATE, PLOT TITLE, PRINT LAB, UNITS, AD AND P SCALE FACTORS OF EACH
  PARAMETER FOLLOW
    1)   1     PROCESSOR TIME (SECONDS) AFTER MIDNIGHT    TIME       SEC    = (N/    1.0) -    0.0
    2)   1     UNALTERED TAPE TIME (SEC) AFTER MIDNIGHT    TPTIME    SEC    = (N/    1.0) -    0.0
    3)   1     CORRECTED STATIC PRESSURE (MB)               PSXC1    MB     = (N/  500.0) -    0.0
    4)   1     AMBIENT TEMP (FUSELAGE ROSEMOUNT) (C)        ATF1     C      = (N/ 1000.0) -  100.0
    5)   1               *** UNUSED ***                   UNUSED            = (N/    1.0) -    0.0
