NAME
----
nc_compare - Compare netCDF files and report differences.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*nc_compare* ['OPTIONS'] 'LEFTFILE' 'RIGHTFILE'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

nc_compare(1) reads two netcdf files and compares their contents, printing
out differences in the dimensions, global attributes, variables, and
variable attributes.  The LEFTFILE and RIGHTFILE are taken as in diff(1),
and the output looks similar to a context diff of ncdump(1) output.  Unlike
diff(1), data values are also compared numerically, and some attributes are
ignored by default since they are expected to be different in different
files.  Also time coordinates are interpreted as times and reported as
different if they do not overlap exactly.

Numberic variables with identical names are compared statistically.  All
the values for each variable are read, missing values removed, and the mean
is computed.  The means of the two variables are used to compute an
absolute difference and a relative error between the variables.  Variables
are reported as different when their means differ according to the current
floating point comparison method.  Statistical differences are printed out
in a table following all the other output, with the variables ordered from
largest relative error to least.

Numeric attribute values are compared as numbers rather than as text.  So
floating point values do not have to be exactly equal to be considered not
different, they just have to compare as equal with the current floating
point comparison method.

By default, floating point values only have to be close to be considered
equal, even if they are not exactly equal.  For all other data types, the
values must be exactly equal or else they are different.  There are two
options for comparing floats, one uses an error delta and the other
compares Units in the Last Place.  See the --delta and --ulps options for
details.


OPTIONS
-------

*--showequal*::

    Show the text summary of every component in the netcdf files, even if
    they are equal between the two files.  Usually only the differences are
    reported.

*--ignore*='IGNORE'::

    Set a variable or attribute name to ignore when checking for
    differences.  By default nc_compare(1) ignores these names which
    typically appear as global attributes and vary for each generation of a
    data file:

    date_created, ProcessorURL, ProcessorRevision, NIDASrevision

    Passing an ignore option resets the list, so you can pass an empty or
    unused name to reset the ignore list and show everything, like so:

    `--ignore ''`

    Multiple ignore options can be used, each use adds a name to the ignore
    list.
    
*--delta*='DELTA'::

    Specify that floating point values must be within DELTA of each other
    to be considered equal.  The default error delta is 1e-6 for 32-bit
    float and 1e-10 for 64-bit float, but this option must be set to change
    the comparison method from the default ULPS method.

*--ulps*='ULPS'::

    Specify that floating point numbers must be within ULPS steps of each
    other to be considered equal.  One floating point number is advanced to
    the next representable floating point value towards the other number,
    and if the numbers are within ULPS steps of each other, they are close
    enough.  The default floating point comparison test uses 4 ULPS.

*--help*::

    Show usage information.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*N*::
    Failure.  The exit status is the number of differences found.


EXAMPLES

.........................
> nc_compare HIPPO/BASE/HIPPO-5rf05.nc HIPPO/HIPPO-5rf05.nc
--- HIPPO/BASE/HIPPO-5rf05.nc (left)
+++ HIPPO/HIPPO-5rf05.nc (right)
variables:
!          float IRIG_Tdiff_LWO(Time) ;
 -                 SerialNumber = "F2DC001" ;
 +                 SerialNumber = "F2DC003" ;
!          float PS_VXL(Time) ;
 -                 actual_range = 183.317749, 1005.51453 ;
 +                 actual_range = 183.318161, 1005.51678 ;
 -                 CalibrationCoefficients = 0, 1.33322001 ;
 +                 CalibrationCoefficients = 0, 1.33322299 ;
   Variable              Left Mean     Right Mean  Abs Error  Rel Err (%)
   --------              ---------     ---------- ---------- ------------
   PS_VXL               629.370728     629.372131  -0.001404         0.00
19 differences.
.........................

The actual_range and CalibrationCoefficients attributes of the PS_VXL
variable differ by more than 4 ULPS, and so they are reported in the
output.  The '-' line shows the values from the LEFTFILE, while the '+'
line shows the RIGHTFILE.  The means for the variable also differ, and so
the statistics for that variable are reported in a table.  If the
`--showequal` option were enabled, then all the dimensions, variables,
attributes and statistics would be shown.
