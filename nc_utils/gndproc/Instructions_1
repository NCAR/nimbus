  Remove "old" disk drive from *TOP* slot of the ZZYZX chassis.
   - Turn the key clockwise one quarter turn to a vertical position.
   - Wait for drive to spin down.  (The LED display will indicate "u"
       when the drive can be removed.)
   - Pull out the drive by its handle.
   - Set this drive on top of the ZZYZX chassis.
     (The LED display should indicate "1" at this time.)
