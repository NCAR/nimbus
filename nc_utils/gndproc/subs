A number of places in the "gndproc" script have code that is virtually
duplicated.  Rather than have the code repeated, it may make sense to convert
these sections to "subroutines" and have the code exist in only one place
within the script.  A setup line (or lines) followed by a "goto $sub" would
execute the "subroutine," and its "return" at the end would be a "goto
$return" where both of these varibles would be loaded with approprate labels.

like snippets:
*  gh ij      <-- very similar, easily resolvable (lines 2 - 18)
*  op st wx   <-- virtually alike
*  mn qr uv   <-- virtually alike
   mn op      <-- some differences which probably are not resolvable
