To add a second ethernet interface to a Solaris workstation:

1) Install the interface.
2) Create /etc/hostname.le1 file with the hostname for the le1 port.  The 
   convention established is to append -data to the le0 hostname, i.e. 
   wheeler and wheeler-data.
3) Add an entry to the /etc/hosts file for the le1 interface hostname.

6) If running with separate subnet numbers, i.e 128.117.84.xx and 
   128.117.184.xx, the machine will automatically come up as a router
   on the next boot.
7) If running with the same subnet on both interfaces, a specific route
   for each machine on the le1 port must be added to the /etc/rc2.d/S72inetsvc
   file, i.e. /usr/sbin/route add dsm5 wheeler-data 0.
8) To add the machine as a router on another machine use the command
   route add net 128.117.184.0 hostname 1
9) If running with the same subnet number on both interfaces, nfs and rlogin
   don't work correctly.  A bridge must be added across the le0 and le1 ports
   to add these services.
10)If running with different subnet numbers, configure the dsms to use the
   le0 hostname for the host, and the le1 hostname as a router.  If running
   with the same subnet numbers, configure the dsms to use the le1 hostname as
   both host and router.
