I released a new version of nimbus.  Here are the changes/additions:

Nimbus:
	- Nothing new.


winput:
	- Modified to handle real-time receiving of AVAPS Dropsonde data for
	  display in WINDS, via a serial port.


AMLIB:
	- AKRD modified for the C-130.

	- Added RATIO.  This allows you to define your own ratio of two
	  parameters.

	- Added DIFF1, DIFF2, DIFF3.  Allows for upto 3 user defined
	  differences.

	- AVAPS Dropsonde support added (this currently only works in
	  real-time onboard).

	- Collins GPS support added (NOAA/GIV).

	- B57 support.

Notes on RATIO & DIFF#.  Both RATIO and DIFF's are not present by default.
They must be added to the proj/###/UserNames file, this will tell nimbus/
winput to add them to the derived variable list.  Then the entry in the
proj/###/DependTable must be modified to caontain what you want.


Ex (2 differences):

UserNames:

DIFF1 DIFF2


DependTable:

RATIO	ADIFR QCXC	# Equates to RATIO = ADIFR - QCXC
DIFF1	TTRL TTRR	# Equates to DIFF1 = TTRL - TTRR
DIFF2	PALT HGM
