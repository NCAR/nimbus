Nimbus 2.1.2 has been released.  Changes are as follows:

AMLIB:

- TASHC has been added.  This Humidity Corrected True AirpSpeed.

- Fixed bug in corrected winds, when being run at high-rate.  This affected
  the corrected winds when they were output at low rate during a high rate
  nimbus run.

- Corrected Winds have been renamed, an X has been placed in front
  of the variables names (i.e. LATC -> XLATC, etc...).  This summer we're
  hoping to replace the code for the corrected winds with a true Kalman
  filter.


Bug fixes:

- Fixed a bug in the 'Toggle Rate' menu item.

- 'Toggle Probe' menu appears to be working correctly.  It has also been turned
  into a "tear off menu" (see below for description and directions).


Code for the Sailplane has been added.

Tear Off Menus
----------------------------------------------------
Tear Off Menus are Motif's version of the Push Pin in XView.  A tear off menu
is identifiable when the first item in a menu is a dashed line.  Selecting
the dashed line places the menu it's own window that can then be moved around.
To remove the torn off menu, just press 'Esc' in the window with the menu.
