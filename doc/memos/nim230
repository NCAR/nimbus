I released a new version of nimbus.  Here are the changes/additions:

Nimbus:
	- Fixed bug in SumCounter(), which was truncating.  Only affected
	  Counters with Cal coes other than 0,1,0.

	- When nimbus asked for Flight Number, it failed to record it in
	  the netCDF file.  Fixed.  This is a production-only feature.

	- Filled time gaps had HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND = -32767:-32767:-32767.
	  Fixed to have actual time.

	- Support for GIV.

	- Added Dismiss & Reset buttons to the 'Edit Time Slice' window.

	- Added a new 'Edit' menu item.  'Edit Flight Info', allows you
	  to edit the flight number, flight date, and aircraft tailnumber.


AMLIB:
	- Added XFCN for ACE-1.

	- Support for GIV.
