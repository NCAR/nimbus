Nimbus 2.0.0 has been released.  Features include:

- Averaging of Analog/Digital channels during real-time has been modified to
  happen before conversion to floating point.  This has the affect of not
  introducing resolution that's not there.  This does not affect post
  processing, and was added mostly to benifit instrumentation in debugging.

- New menu item Toggle Rate (^R) has been added to provide quick method for
  toggling Output rates.  This works in the same manner as the Toggle Output
  (^O) menu item.

- Overhauled AMLIBs access to data, which allowed a smoother flow of data
  for high-rate.  This will/should speed up high-rate runs by 10%-15%.

- Despike module added.  See me for directions (it's not part of the GUI yet).
  This will only detect and remove single-point spikes, new points are generated
  using the LaGrange quadratic interpolation.  It does not remove spikes
  gratuitously, you must turn the module on.

- Sample-rate computation of PMS1D derived data now available.  If you choose
  a high-rate run, PMS1D will be computed at whatever rate it was sampled.
  Low-rate unaffected.  Two caveats: 1) The first 10 out of 25 samples for
  TASX are used (i.e. I'm distributing the first 1/2 second of TASX over the
  whole second for the PMS1D derived computations).  2)  You can't use any
  of the PMS1D raw or derived as inputs to another derived variable via the
  DependTable.

- Converted to ANSI C.

- Several minor bug fixes in the GUI, and anything else I forgot.

------- AMLIB modifications ---------

- CN Counter, fix for high-rate CONCN.

- Replaced out of date PSURF calculation.

- Calculations for Licor 6262, XCO2C & XMRLI updated.
