	Instructions on how to add probes into the nimbus source code.


Directories:

  amlib/std		RAF supported derived variable computations.
  amlib/user		User requested derived variable computations.
  amlib/xlate		Functions for extracting variables from block probes.

There is a template.c file in each of the "AMLIB" directories for making/adding
new probes/variables.


How to add a probe.
	1) Add xlate routines to get "raw" data.
	2) Add std or user routines to create derived variables.
	3) Edit hdr_decode.c to decode whatever header info on ADS tape.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Step 1 is extracting "raw" variables stored on the ADS tape.  If all raw
   variables are SDI Anolog or Digital channels, then skip this step.  This
   step is for if the raw data comes in a block similar to IRS or PMS1D.

   cd xlate; cp template.c new_probe.c

   Edit new_probe.c and add a function for each variable you want to extract
from the structure stored on the ADS tape.  By convention each function name
starts with 'xl'.

   For each variable you want extracted, you must create a name and add it to
the file ${NIMBUS}/include/amlib.fns.  The corresponding function name goes
in the first column of amlib.fns (Derived functions go in the second column).
Example entry (Ophir III):

	"OGAIN",	NULL,	xlogain,	NULL,
	"OBBCOD",	NULL,	xlobbcod,	NULL,
	"ODETDC",	NULL,	xlodetdc,	NULL,
	"OTSNT",	NULL,	xlotsnt,	NULL,
	"OTBNCH",	NULL,	xlotbnch,	NULL,
	"OTDET",	NULL,	xlotdet,	NULL,
	"OTBBC",	NULL,	xlotbbc,	NULL,
	"OTBBF",	NULL,	xlotbbf,	NULL,
	"OSMOTR",	NULL,	xlosmotr,	NULL,
	"ODETSG",	NULL,	xlodetsg,	NULL,
	"OTBOX",	NULL,	xlotbox,	NULL,

Add the new file name to the Makefile in the xlate directory.


cd ${LOCAL}/proj/defaults and create a file probe_name.names, that hdr_decode.c
will read to get these names from.  Examples are in *.names.  You can be
creative here and add other important information about the variables here
(see irs.names, ophir3.names, and any pms1d.names file).


-------------------------------------
2) Step 2 is creating/adding any "derived" variables you may want.  If you
   have no derived variables, then goto step 3.

   cd ../std; cp template.c new_probe.c
or
   cd ../user; cp template.c new_probe.c

   Edit new_probe.c and add a function for each variable you want created.
By convention each function starts with 's'.  Look at some of the other
files to see how dependancies (input variables) are extracted.

   For each variable you want created, you must create a name and add it to
the file ${NIMBUS}/include/amlib.fns.  The corresponding function name goes
in the second column of amlib.fns.  Example entry (Ophir III):

	"OAT",		NULL,	NULL,	soat,
	"OBBCR",	NULL,	NULL,	sobbcr,
	"ODETOF",	NULL,	NULL,	sodetof,
	"ODSIGC",	NULL,	NULL,	sodsigc,
	"OGAINF",	NULL,	NULL,	sogainf,
	"OTDETC",	NULL,	NULL,	sotdetc,

Add the new file name to the Makefile (in nimbus/src/amlib/[std|user]).


cd ${LOCAL}/proj/defaults and add an entry to 'DerivedNames'.  Example entry:

	OPHIR3	OAT OTDETC ODSIGC OBBCR OGAINF ODETOF
or
	GPS	GALT GLAT GLON GMODE GSTAT GSF

cd ${NIMBUS}/proj/defaults and add appropriate dependancies to 'DependTable'.
The dependancies you put in here will become the inputs to the functions.
Example entry:

	OAT	OBBCOD ODETDC OTDET OTBBC ODETSG


-------------------------------------
3) Step 3 is to edit hdr_decode.c, and add the processing to decode the
header information about this probe.  This step sucks.  Lots of "special
cases" exist here to handle how the probe works.  Be creative, I've left
lot's of loopholes (e.g.  By placing an SDI variable in the amlib.fns file
you can get the variable processed by an xlate function, see HGM & PSFD).
