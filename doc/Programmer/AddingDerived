This file provides a simple example for adding a derived variable.  This
example will assume that you have an analog channel being sampled, and you'd
like to create a derived concentration.  Our example will use 'CNTS' as our
analog variable and 'CONCN' as our derived variable.


Order of these steps is not important.

1)  Edit the '$PROJ_DIR/defaults/DependTable' file and add a line setting up
    the dependencies.  In this case CONCN depends upon CNTS, and let's say
    true air speed also:

CONCN	CNTS TASX


2)  Edit the '$PROJ_DIR/defaults/DerivedNames' file and add a line telling
    nimbus that if it sees CNTS, that it should add a derived variable named
    CONCN:

CNTS	CONCN


3)  cd $NIMBUS/src/amlib/[std|user]*, and cp template.c concn.c.  Now edit
    concn.c to contain the appropriate computation.  Add concn.c to the
    Makefile.


4)  Edit '$NIMBUS/include/amlib.fns' and add a line equating CONCN with a
    C function.  This is the file that equates variable names with actual
    routines.  If someone can figure out how to do this without recompiling,
    I'll give you a weeks salary.

5)  Make nimbus.

6)  Tinker with steps 1-5 until it works.



* At NCAR/RAF, the 'std' directory is for blessed instruments/computations,
  the 'user' directory is for [piggy back | fly by night | we'll never see
  this again | are you sure this will work? | chemistry] instruments.
