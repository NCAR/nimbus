			Nimbus' Multi-rate Filter(s)

Filtering is done via a multi-rate FIR filter.  Requirements are to keep the
attenuation in the StopBand down around 80db, with very nominal ripple in the
PassBand.


There are 4 low pass Parks-McClellan filters used for processing:

					Corner frequencies (nyquist = 1)
Filter #	nTaps	Factor	Type	 Pass band	Stop band
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New filters:
Interp		Preserve
		Bandwidth
  1 -> 25	0.5hz	50	[0.0 - 0.02, 0.08 - 1.0] weight to 1.0019
  5 -> 25	2.0hz	50	[0.0 - 0.15, 0.22 - 1.0] weight to 0.999245
 10 -> 25	4.4hz	100	[0.0 - 0.35, 0.42 - 1.0] weight to 0.9993

 25 -> 25	12.5hz	100	[0.0 - 0.92, 1.0 - 1.0]

Decim
 50 -> 25	11hz	100	[0.0 - 0.46, 0.53 - 1.0]  weight to 0.99932
250 -> 25	12hz	500	[0.0 - 0.096, 0.111 - 1.0]  weight to 1.00048

1000 -> 25	10hz	1000	[0.0 - 0.016, 0.025 - 1.0]  weight to 1.000055


The filters were generated using the remez() function in MATLAB's signal
toolbox.

Command to generate
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
b=remez(100, [0.0, 0.08, 0.1, 1.0], [1.000055, 1.000055, 0.0, 0.0]);

Test plot()
[h,f]=freqz(b,1,4096,SampleRate);
plot(f, 20*log10(abs(h)))
