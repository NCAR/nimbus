		Cheat Sheet for Production Procedures


Assumptions:

	- Any new variables that should be summed and NOT averaged have
		been entered into the 'proj/defaults/sumvars' file.

	- Any new variables that are circular (LON, THDG, WD) have been
		entered into the 'proj/defaults/modvars' file.

	- Any variables that have a static time lag for all flights have
		been entered into the 'proj/###/lags' file.

	- Any variables that need despiking for all flights have been
		entered into the 'proj/###/despike' file.

	- The 'proj/###/Defaults' and 'proj/###/DependTable' files are setup
		to represent the largest set of flights (Changes for other
		flights should be entered at run time).

	- You are happy with the data, and have "setup" files for the different
		groupings of flights.  You may have a group for each flight
		or several flights, or one group for all the flights.
		It is possible to need no setup files if nothing ever changed
		from the initial setup of CalCoe's and all the flights
		remained uniform for Defaults, etc (I expect this to be
		highly improbable).


Steps:

1) cd project directory and make sure there is a 'Production' directory.
	(hl proj/###/Production).  If it does not exist then come see
	someone in computing (The directory is to be owned by 'nimbus'
	with NO 'other' write permissions).

	drwxrwsr-x  2 nimbus   proj          512 Dec 30 10:00 Production/


2) Login as the user 'nimbus'.  See computing if you don't know the password.


3) Configure the FlightGroups file in the Production directory.  This can
	be done with 'xpman' or 'vi'.  If there isn't a sample file there,
	then see computing.  (This file should also be owned by 'nimbus'
	with only owner write permission).


4) You will need to run nimbus again for all the flights.  'Load' setups
	from your personal space and then 'Save' them, it will not ask you
	for a file name, instead it saves it in the Production directory
	with specific names.

	By default, running nimbus as 'nimbus', will set the output file
	directory to /home/local/staticdata, instead of /home/local/data.
	staticdata has no scrubber, and thus production files will remain
	until they have been moved to the mass-store.

	By convention name production files pppRFff.cdf, where ppp is the
	project number and ff is the flight number with leading zero.


FlightGroups example:

	If the contents of FlightGroups is:

		2 == 1
		3 == 1
		7 == 6
		10 == 9
		12 == 11


	Then you only need setups for flights 1,6,9, & 11.  Flights 2,3,7,
	10, & 12 should have NO setup file.  Flights 4,5, & 8 either have
	no setup file or have individual setup files.


5) It is highly recommended that you create a file in proj/###/Production
	directory which contains any special processing steps you took, or
	notes about the project.
