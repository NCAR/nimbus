X11-independent imake

by John Clyne

1. Introduction
---------------

ncar_imake is an X11-independent version of X's imake. I.e. its
imake without all the ties to X11 that make imake difficult to use
for non-X projects. For example, ncar_imake doesn't insist on
installing executables in /usr/bin/X11. Installation directories
in ncar_imake can easily be set up on a per-project basis.

ncar_imake has a number of other nice features that distinguish it
from imake. Too many to go into here. 

Most imake Imakefile files should work without modification with 
ncar_imake.


2. Compiling and Installation
-----------------------------

This release of ncar_imake has been compiled and tested on the following 
systems:

	Cray	Unicos 9.x
	Cray	Unicos 8.x
	DEC	OSF1 4.0
	SGI	Irix 6.2
	Sun	Solaris	2.5.1
	HP	HP-UX 10.0

To compile and build on one of the above systems do the following:

	(a) Edit the file cf/site.def. Make sure the ProjectRoot
	    macro is defined to a suitable path for the top of 
	    the installation tree. Ncar_imake will install files
	    in $ProjectRoot/bin and $ProjectRoot/lib. If you bin and
	    lib need to have different parent directories, use the
	    BinDir and LibDir macros to define separate bin and lib
	    installation directory paths. E.g.

		#define	BinDir	/something/bin
		#define LibDir	/somethingelse/lib

	(b) Type the following to build ncar_imake:

		% make -f Makefile.ini World

	(c) To install type:

		% make install

	    That's it. You're done.



3. Getting Started
------------------


You can now use ncar_imake in much the same way as Imake. For a good 
reference on Imake see the O'Reilly book, "Software Portability with 
Imake", by Paul DuBois.

For small projects you'll want to use the stock ncar_imake configuration
environment that you just installed. If you've defined ProjectRoot
to be /usr/local for Ncar_imake, then this is the same project root
that will be used for Imakefiles outside of ncar_imake. 

Ncar_imake's greatest flexibility is gained when you create a custom
configuration environment for a project. Just create a 'cf' subdirectory
at the root or your projects source tree, populate this directory
with whatever config files you want to override ncar_imake's config
files, and then bootstrap the top-level Imakefile with the command:

	% ncar_imboot -p topdir .

For example. If ncar_imake was configured with ProjectRoot set to 
/usr/local, but you were working on a project where you wanted to 
ProjectRoot to be /usr/myprojectname, just create a file called
cf/Project.p-tmpl and add the line:

	#define ProjectRoot /usr/myprojectname.

Then bootstrap with the above ncar_imboot command.
