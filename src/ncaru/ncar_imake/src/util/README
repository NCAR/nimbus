This directory contains some things the standard X11 util/scripts doesn't.

imboot.cpp - source for the bootstrapper imboot.
imdent.pl - perl script to add/remove indention to/from cpp directives
	according to #if/#endif levels.  You might need to edit the first
	line if your perl isn't in /usr/local.
which.csh, which.1 - csh version of which and man page.  From the
	redistributable BSD sources on ftp.uu.net.
which.sh - Bourne shell version of which.


bsdinst.sh and install.sh are part of the X11 distribution; you may need
to use them if your system doesn't have a working BSD version of install.
bsdinst.sh is more commonly used.  install.sh is used on Crays, and,
apparently, under Linux.
