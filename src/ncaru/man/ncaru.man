.SH NAME
ncaru  - Introduction to library libncaru.a
.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes the contents of the NCAR local library
libncaru.a.  This library contains a number of Fortran routines you can
use to read and write Cray blocked or unblocked files and perform
numeric conversions from Cray format to IEEE format.  The library also
contains some timing routines as well as the Cray packer routines.
.PP
The ncaru library is not threadsafe.  Ensure that any calls to this
library only ocurr in a single threaded region.
