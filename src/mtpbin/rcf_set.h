 ** 
 ** The Microwave Temperature Profiler (MTP) instrument build by JPL for
 ** NCAR as part of the set of instruments known as HAIS (build specifically
 ** in support of the Haiper GV aircraft) came with processing software 
 ** written in Visual Basic 6.0. 
 **
 ** A set of Retrieval Coefficient Files (RCFs) are currently written 
 ** by the VB program RCCalc which takes RAOB data and converts it into 
 ** Templates that describe what that RAOB profile would look like to the MTP 
 ** instrument if the instrument was used to measure the atmosphere described 
 ** by the profile. 
 **
 ** When the MTP instrument completes a scan of the atmosphere the scan counts
 ** are converted to Brightness Temperatures, using these the "best match" 
 ** RCF is found and it's corresponding Retrieval Coefficients are used
 ** to determine the atmospheric temperature profile.
 ** 
 ** This class encapsulates the whole set of RCFs for a project and provides
 ** a method for determining which of the RCFs is the best match of a given
 ** set of brightness temperatures (scan) taken at a particular elevation.
