(For a more detailed discussion of the installation process, see the
document _Valkyrie Maintenance Manual_.)

To build the system:

	1) Inspect the following Makefiles, and change if necessary

		./Makefile
		./socklib/Makefile
		./timerlib/Makefile
		./gui/Makefile
		./vallib/Makefile

	2) Type 'make' from root of the source distribution

To install after build:

	1) Type 'make install' from root of the source distribution.
	   This does the following actions:

		cp gui/qc-gui $(WINDS)/bin
		cp vallib/libval.a $(NIMBUS)/lib
		cp vallib/qc.h $(NIMBUS)/include

	(The man page (man/qc.l) will ultimately get copied to 
	/usr/local/man/manl when permission issues are resolved).
