# nimbus
Primary EOL/RAF aircraft data processor.

Aircraft data derivation and quality-control processing. NIMBUS is the workhorse of aircraft data integrity and computation. It runs in real-time on the airplane during flights and it also reprocesses flights on the ground into netCDF as quality-control and processing parameters are fine-tuned post-flight.

History:  
Developed in the early 1990's to combine the Cray GENPRO processing package and the RAF quick look processor DAP into the primary RAF data processor.
