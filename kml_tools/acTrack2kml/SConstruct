# LINKFLAGS does not work, because LINKFLAGS is expanded on the command
# line *before* LIBFLAGS.  There is no way to specify the libraries as
# static in LIBS, since members of LIBS are always expanded to -l<lib>.
# The only way to avoid that would be to replace the _stripixes() function,
# and I don't want to go there.  I've been there, and it's not pretty.

# checks appeared to do before were add -lnetcdf_c++ and -lpq to the LIBS,
# but those had already been given on the command line anyway.  Really this
# could be removed, since if netcdf or pq aren't installed, then the build
# will still fail.  However it's left here in case someday someone wants to
