	Digital Port Description, Addressing, and Channel Numbering

1. Standard 8 bit digital inputs and outputs.

There are 8 standard digital I/O ports per VMIO12 board.  Each port consists of 
8 bits which are programmed by software as either inputs or outputs.  
Even numbered ports also have 2 auxilliary input only bits available .
A maximum of 2 boards may be installed in any one DSM.  The digital ports are 
accessed through 2 96 pin DIN connectors on the front of the VMIO12 card.
Each 8 bit port is wired to a 26 pin MS style connector on the back of the DSM.
Refer to the attached drawing for the wiring connections.

Digital input addresses are of the hex form 0x00XY where X is the board number,
either 0 or 1, and Y is the port number, 0-7.  Thus the address 0x0015 refers
to the port 5 on board 1. 0x0003 refers to port 3 on board 0 

The back of the DSM has the digital port connectors labeled as D1 through D8.
Assuming these connectors are wired to the digital ports in a sequential 
fashion, D1 would correspond to address 0x0000, D2 to address 0x0001, etc.
At present there is no connector accomodation to handle more than 8 digital
ports in a DSM, even though the software can handle a second board.

2. 16 bit digital inputs.

A few instruments provide digital output words which are 16 bits in length.
The MCR status word is an example of this.  Addressing for these instruments
is the same as for the standard 8 bit ports, except that only even port numbers
may be assigned.  Thus address 0x0000 would refer to port 2 on board 0.  The
instrument would be wired into ports 2 and 3.  The software recognizes the
instrument as a 16 bit instrument by its name.  When the ports are sampled,
ports 2 and 3 are concatenated into a single 16 bit word.  At present there
is no way in the header to define a digital input as either 8 or 16 bits.  Thus
specific instrument names are coded into the DSM software.  This is an issue
that needs to be dealt with in the future. 

3. Digital Pressure.

The digital pressure is a special digital interface that requires 18 bits.  The
digital pressure is recorded as 2 16 bit words named PSFD1 and PSFD2.  The 
additional 2 most significant bits are acquired through the 2 auxilliary bits
described above on the even numbered port.  The auxilliary bits are addressed
as addresses 8, A, B, and C which correspond to the auxilliary bits available
on the port 0, 2, 4, and 6 connectors.  An example of valid digital pressure
addresses would be 0x0000 for PSFD1 and 0x0008 for PSFD2.  For this example,
PSFD is assigned to ports 0 and 1 of board 0, and PSFD2 is assigned to the
aux bits on the port 0 connector of board 0.  Totally straightforward.

4. Counters.

Each Vmio12 board provides 8 counters.  The counters are available only 
through the odd numbered ports, however.  Two counters may be accessed
through each odd numbered port.  The format of the counter addresses is
0x0ZXY. X is the board number. Y is the port number, 1, 3, 5, or 7.
Z identifies the counter number on that port, 0 or 1.  Counter number 0 is
accessed through bit 5 of the port, and counter timer 1 is accessed through
bit 1 of the port.  An example of a counter address would be 0x0005.  This
address refers to counter 0 on port 5 of board 0. Address 0x0103 refers to
counter 1 on port 3 of board 0.
