#  FILE: netconfig
#
# Fields are position (mode), display-host, port server host, x-resolution, 
# y-resolution, serial port output for ttya, and then for ttyb, and finally 
# project number.
#
# Edit this file as needed for given project setup.  The part you will
# modify is in the example sections that follow all this introductory text, 
# headed with either "POST-PROCESSING clients" or "REAL-TIME clients". 
# The lines that need editing are those that start without a # in the first 
# column. Do NOT, however, remove or modify these lines:
#
mode    dhost    phost    x-res    y-res    ttya    ttyb    pnum
----    ----     -----    -----    -----    ----    ----    ----
#
# All possible names for mode and tty[a|b] are listed in the mode and 
# tty[a|b] columns, respectively, as examples only. Be sure to modify them 
# as needed to fit reality. See the WINDS User Manual for details on 
# the ttya/b field values.
#
# The mode value is discussed at length in the example entries. Generally, 
# there are two types of WINDS modes: real-time and post-processing, with 
# specific sets of values for each of these. The mode field is used to 
# designate which mode and specific value is to be used.
#
# Replace dhost with display hostname. This is the host on whom the winds
# process is to be displayed. It need not be the same host as the one on which
# winds is executed, but in this case x-protocol display permission must be
# granted for the compute host (do a "man xhost"). You may have as many 
# entries, each with a different dhost value, as needed in this file, to
# provide for all the display hosts in your network.  The longest string 
# allowed for dhost is 64 characters.
#
# WINDS is invoked with optional command line arguments that are used to find 
# an entry here with matching parameters. If there is more than one entry 
# with matching parameters, the first one encountered will be used by WINDS.  
# This includes the invocation without any arguments: the very first entry
# found, in this case, with display host equal to the executing host, will be 
# the one used to configure the session. It's possibly useful for those who 
# invoke WINDS without arguments, e.g. from a menu, to take advantage of this: 
# create as many entries as you need to represent ALL of your datasets, knowing 
# that WINDS (invoked without any arguments) will display the first entry 
# with matching host seen in this file, and simply edit as needed to change 
# the display. 
#
# Replace phost with port server hostname if any -- use value "none" if no 
# printer. The port server host is the host supplying serial ports for
# printing, etc., and often is the same as the dhost (but need not be...). See 
# the WINDS Installation Manual and WINDS User Manual for details. If 
# a host is named "none", punt. Then contact a WINDS expert for help.  The 
# longest string allowed for phost is 64 characters.
#
# Columns ttya and ttyb correspond to the serial line output ports of same name
# (on Sun backplanes); the values for each should indicate what printer (or, in 
# real-time mode, other serial output) is connected on the port server host.
# The only printers WINDS *explicitly* supports are the HP PaintJet and the
# Epson wide-carriage printer. If you *are* using one of these, or any other
# printer configured to the correct protocol over ttya or ttyb, set the 
# tty[a|b] column(s) to the correct value(s) for the type of printer(s) in use. 
# You need do nothing here for PostScript printing. See the WINDS Installation 
# / User Manuals for details.
#
# Replace pnum with project number.  A project number can be any value you want 
# to give as an identifier for the given dataset(s) to be processed; it can be 
# a name or a number or any ASCII string. Often, datasets have a project number 
# already associated with them on distribution, and sometimes it makes sense 
# to retain that value (consulting, etc.). The only important connection the 
# pnum value must have is its relation to dataset files' location if the 
# WINDS default directory $WINDS/data/<pnum> is used and, regardless of 
# dataset location, its relation to the project config files in the 
# $WINDS/project/<pnum> subdirectory. 
#
# In post-processing mode, the dataset name field (either netcdfname or 
# dapname) must be filled in as well; its value is used to construct 
# the filename of the dataset to be used for the WINDS session. See the 
# WINDS Installation Manual, section titled "Installing Datasets" for details.
# 
# Add your own comments to this file by starting a line with # character.
# Please note that no line (as defined as the record that will be read in by
# C library function gets()) in this file is to exceed 128 characters.
# All of these lines already here are obviously OK, so just use them as a 
# template and your comments won't blow up the software.
# 
# See the WINDS User Manual for more info on all of above (section 
# titled "Network Configuration").

# POST-PROCESSING clients:
#
# Field mode is either analyze or netcdf, to process RAF's DAP or Unidata's
# netCDF format files, respectively.
#
# Note special format for pnum field in analyze/netcdf modes.  Filename 
# entries ARE case-sensitive.  See WINDS Installation Manual for conventions
# assumed on pnum value's relation to files used.
# 
# Values are supplied for the ttya and ttyb columns as examples only.
# Be sure to modify them as needed to fit reality. See the WINDS User 
# Manual for details on the ttya/b field values.
#
# The value for either <pnum>, <netcdfname> or <dapname> should be no 
# more than 5 characters in length. Longer values than this will work ok, but 
# will not be displayed in full in the WINDS Control Panel area. However, 
# the longest value for pnum is 16 characters, and for either dataset name is
# 64 characters.
