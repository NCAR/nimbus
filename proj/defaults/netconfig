#  FILE: netconfig
#
# This file configures WINDS sessions for both onboard in real-time and inhouse
# for post-processing modes. It is essential for correct operation of the former 
# and optional for the latter, though it is useful in post-processing environment
# as a means of saving command line startup combinations and thus useful in not 
# only providing multiple startup possibilities but also in invoking WINDS with 
# minimal arguments.
#
# Fields are position (mode), display-host, port server host, x-resolution, 
# y-resolution, serial port output for ttya, and then for ttyb, and finally 
# project number.
#
# Additional entries to indicate NFS server and Parallax/NetVUE video servers
# are also exemplified and discussed in what follows.
#
# Edit this file as needed for given project setup.  The part you will
# modify is in the EXAMPLE section that follow this introduction.
# 
# Edit ALL lines that are not commented out (# in the first 
# column)...EXCEPT, however, for these next 2 lines (do NOT modify):
#
mode    dhost    phost    x-res    y-res    ttya    ttyb    pnum

# Change the dhost field (nfsserver) to the NFS Server, which MUST also be the
# WINDS Server (i.e. host from which WINDS processes are executed) but may be 
# distinct from the ControlHost (ctl entry). Also change the phost field 
# (core-file-save-directory) to a location for saving corefiles; this is to be any
# directory pathname in a partition with enough room to contain multiple core files.
# A good candidate onboard is some pathname under /home, e.g. /home/corefiles. This
# directory need not exist, it will be created at proj_setup time; and definitely 
# change the pnum field to current project number:
# 
nfs     nfsserver core-file-save-directory 0    0     none    none    pnum
#
# Indicate hosts on local net that contain the Parallax Video card and thus
# can serve network video within the NetVUE scheme. Change serverhostname
# to name of host; serverdisplay, for now, is ALWAYS ":0.1"; location of 
# half-sized video windows are indicated by next two fields, the xpos and
# ypos -- to align three along bottom, starting from right side, use following
# combinations: (822,650), (492,650), (162,650)...stack 4, 2x2, in lower right:
# (492,370), (492,650), (822,650), (492,650); title is what appears in frame
# border of video window; framespeed is requested frames per second (which
# currently does not seem to have an effect, default rate of 8 fps results 
# regardless of this entry); and dummy is a necessary placeholder for now.

# MODE
#
# Possible names for mode include:
#
# netcdf
#
# Post-processing mode -- input is to be from a netcdf file whose filename is 
# derived from the pnum field (pnum-netcdfname). See comments below on PNUM for
# details on this.
#
# setup 
#
# In-house, you may optionally use setup mode for preliminary sessions IF a
# header is ready and a dataset is not; after a dataset is ready you should
# start using devctl or netcdf mode (see below). 
#
# devctl 
#
# In-house simulated real-time mode, getting data from ADS data file.
#
# ctl
#
# Position ctl is the onboard winds host, i.e. the main controlling station 
# providing communication with ads. Be sure to set the project number for ctl. 
# Setting it for the calcart (see below) is also an excellent idea. 
#
# IMPORTANT: make sure the FIRST entry in this file with the ctl (or devctl) 
# position is the one designating the project number and ControlHost for the project or 
# the print server, e.g, won't find its display-host's associated ControlHost and will 
# terminate! 
#
# dev
#
# use the dev mode for general purpose slave display. These hosts will not
# be auto-started or auto-killed in the onboard turnkey mechanisms, but are
# useful for concurrent sessions off-board, e.g. on the cal-cart or in-house
# debugging.  You don't want the calcart auto-killed since it may be on the
# network in session with some other airplane when your airplane shuts down.
#
# nfs
#
# nfs entry is used to determine the host that is the NFS Server AND the "WindsServer", 
# i.e. it sets the value of environment variable WindsServer, used by each real-time host 
# and the ControlHost for various things. This entry for the onboard "mode" of this same 
# host MUST PRECEDE THIS ENTRY! NOTE: NFS Server and WINDS Server MUST be the same host!
#
# 2nd column is name of NFS server; 3rd is the filesystem location for 
# saving core files found during the Monitor's examinations of file system.
# Make sure to also change pnum here to current project number so proj_setup
# knows who the WindsServer is for given project.
#
# Onboard, other modes are slaves in some other airplane position:
#
# ckp - airplane position: cockpit
# fwd - airplane position: forward cabin
# obl - airplane position: outboard left
# obr - airplane position: outboard right
# ibl - airplane position: inboard left
# ibr - airplane position: inboard right
#
######################################################################################
# DHOST
#
# Replace dhost with display hostname. This is the host on whom the winds
# process is to be displayed. It need not be the same host as the one on which
# winds is executed, but in this case x-protocol display permission must be
# granted for the compute host (do a "man xhost"). You may have as many 
# entries, each with a different dhost value, as needed in this file, to
# provide for all the display hosts in your network.  The longest string 
# allowed for dhost is 64 characters.
#
######################################################################################
# PHOST
#
# Replace phost with port server hostname if any -- use value "none" if no 
# port services. The port server host is the host supplying serial ports for
# printing, etc., and often is the same as the dhost (but need not be...). 
# If a host is named "none", this mechanism fails. Contact WINDS expert for help.  
# The longest string allowed for phost is 64 characters.
#
######################################################################################
# X-RES/Y-RES
#
# Insert desired pixel resolution for width and height, respectively, of WINDS window. 
# Window size won't be adjusted any smaller than about 640 x 480. Nominal sizing is
# already set in examples.
#
######################################################################################
# TTYA/TTYB
#
# Columns ttya and ttyb correspond to the serial line output ports of same name
# (on Sun backplanes); the values for each should indicate what printer (or, in 
# real-time mode, other serial output) is connected on the port server host.
# The only printers WINDS *explicitly* supports are the HP 1200/1600/PaintJet 
# and Epson wide-carriage printer. To use one of these (or, really, *any* other
# printer configured to the correct protocol...) over ttya or ttyb, set the 
# tty[a|b] column(s) to the correct value(s) for the type of printer(s) in use. 
# You need do nothing here for PostScript printing. 
#
# Possible names for tty[a|b] include (NOTE: no guarantee that these are
# up to date! Consult WINDS User Manual to be certain):
# 
# none - no output device
# 1200c - HP 1200C printer, serial Sun to Parallel printer (with S/P converter)
# p1200c - HP 1200C printer, parallel port both ends
# ppjet - HP PaintJet printer, parallel port both ends
# spjet - HP PaintJet printer, serial port both ends
# pjet - HP PaintJet printer, serial Sun to Parallel printer (with S/P converter)
# epson - Epson printer
# ascii - Serial Line Ascii Feed (values only)
# lcd - Serial Line Ascii Feed (LCD display)
# flip - Serial Line Ascii Feed (FLIP display)
# hptp - HP Thermal printer (unsupported, actually)
#
# Serial Line Ascii Feed goes out indicated ttya IFF the associated configuration 
# file is setup properly.
#
######################################################################################
# PNUM
#
# Replace pnum with project number.  A project number can be any value you want 
# to give as an identifier for the given dataset(s) to be processed; it can be 
# a name or a number or any ASCII string. Often, datasets have a project number 
# already associated with them on distribution, and sometimes it makes sense 
# to retain that value (consulting, etc.). The only important connection the 
# pnum value must have is its relation to dataset files' location if the 
# WINDS default directory $WINDS/data/<pnum> is used and, regardless of 
# dataset location, its relation to the project config files in the 
# $WINDS/project/<pnum> subdirectory. 
#
# In post-processing mode, the dataset name field (netcdfname)
# must be filled in as well; its value is used to construct the filename of 
# the dataset to be used for the WINDS session. Filename entries ARE case-sensitive.  
# In this mode, the search for a netcdf file named <netcdfname>[.cdf] is conducted
# sequentially until (not) found under the following directories: $DATA_DIR, 
# $DATA_DIR/<pnum>, and $WINDS/data/<pnum>. If the '.cdf' extension is not supplied
# as part of netcdfname, it will be appended before the search commences.
#
# The value for either <pnum> or <netcdfname> are recommended to be no 
# more than 5 characters in length. Longer values than this will work ok, but 
# may have some of their text truncated in the WINDS Control Panel area. However, 
# the longest value for pnum is 16 characters, and for either dataset name is
# 64 characters.
#
######################################################################################
# ETCETERA
#
# WINDS is invoked with optional command line arguments that are used to find 
# an entry here with matching parameters. If there is more than one entry with 
# parameters that match all given arguments, the first such match seen is the winner.
# This includes the invocation without any arguments: the very first entry
# found, in this case, with display host equal to the executing host, will be 
# the one used to configure the session. It's possibly useful for those who 
# invoke WINDS without arguments, e.g. from a menu, to take advantage of this: 
# create as many entries as you need to represent ALL of your datasets, knowing 
# that WINDS (invoked without any arguments) will use the first entry with matching 
# host seen in this file, and simply edit that first entry as needed to change 
# the display. 
#
# Add your own comments to this file by starting a line with # character.
# Please note that no newline-terminated entry in this file is to exceed 128 
# characters. The lines in the original version of this file are obviously OK, 
# so just use them as a template and your comments won't blow up the software.
