ncmerge \- netCDF merge utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ncmerge [-v var0,var1,...,varn] primary_file secondary_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ncmerge 
is a program for merging two netCDF files which both conform to
the NCAR-RAF/nimbus conventions.  ncmerge will take the secondary_file
and merge it into the primary_file.  If the -v option is used, then only
variables in the variable list will be merged from the secondary file into
the primary_file.  The two files must have some overlaping time segment
in order for ncmerge to work.

.SH BUGS
.PP
There is potential for screwing up the output file.  If the time segment
for the secondary file is a subset of the primary file, and there is a
variable that exists in both files, and one file used different calibration
coeffecients, then the resulting output file will have data for the same
variable computed with different calCoes.
