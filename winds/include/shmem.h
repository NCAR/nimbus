/* shared memory keys:  these must be changed whenever
    the size of the shared memory object INCREASES in size

   two types of keys: shared and non-shared.  Shared keys must all be unique;
   they are effectively keys for read-only shared memory, shared by all
   display stations WINDS processes.  Non-shared keys are keys to 
   session-unique segments of shared memory, effectively isolated from
   other display stations.  Their final values, in calls to getmem(), are
   determined by adding value of variable display_number to following keys.
   Hence, each of the non-shared keys must vary by at least the value of
   the maximum # listed in $WINDS/defaults/netconfig to avoid overlap.
