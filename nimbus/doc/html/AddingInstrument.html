<h1 align=center>Adding a Serial instrument to the ADS-II data system.</h1>
<hr>
This document uses an existing serial instrument (Digital Pressure, Dpres) as
a concrete example.  You may search for the examples used in the code.  The
ADS code is written to only handle one Dpres, whereas you will see examples
of other serial instruments where the code is written to handle more than
one of the given instrument (you will see 'for ()' loops, and MAX_MYPROBE, etc).
<hr>

<b>local/include/header.h</b>
<ul>
<li>A string definition needs to be added (e.g. #define DPRES_STR "DPRES").  This string will be copied into the 'item_type' field of the header structure (e.g. Blk).
<p>
<li>Add a struct for the data block you would like recorded (not for the incoming data, though they may be the same).  By convention these end with '_blk' (e.g. Dpres_blk).
</ul>
<p>

<b>ads</b>
<ul>
<b>disc/include</b>
<ul>
<li>For serial instruments <b>dsmctl.h</b> must be edited to add which serial
port the given instrument will be plugged in (e.g. DPRES_PORT).  This should
really be configurable through <b>xbuild</b>, not hard coded.
<p>
<li>Edit <b>TapeHeader.h</b> to add '*Type()' (e.g.  dpresType()), don't
forget to the new type to 'blkType()' if it is using the <b>struct Blk</b>.
</ul>
<p>

<b>dsm/class</b>
<ul>
<li>Create a new class (e.g. Dpres.h and Dpres.cc).  For data acquisition two
data buffers are required.  Data is not removed from the class until after
1/10 of second into the following second.  The [toggle] buffers are indexed
via 'ptog' (put toggle buffer), and 'gtog' (get/read toggle buffer).  A member
function called 'secondAlign()' is typically used to flip these indices to
the other buffer.  An inerupt service routine (typically called 'isr()') is
required to read the data.  Don't forget to add class to Makefile.
<p>
<li><b>SyncRecord.cc</b>:  New class created above must be added to the
constructor, and a new 'build*()' (e.g.  buildDpres()) function must be added
to copy the data from the class into the record which will be recorded.
<p>
<li><b>SampleTable.cc</b> must be edited to.  Replicate a the <b>dpres</b>
example.
</ul>
<p>

<b>dsm/src</b>
<ul>
There is quit a bit of work in <b>dsmAsync.cc</b>.  initSerial() needs the
new instrument added, along with serial isr() wrapper function.  secondAlign()
needs to be called from hertz50_isr(), and checkStatus() from the main loop.
Follow an example. 
</ul>
<p>

</ul>

<b>hdr_api</b>
<ul>
For most instruments (struct Blk) it is sufficient to edit get_itemtype() in
<b>init.c</b> and add a strcmp(), for the new probe name, in the switch/case.
More complex instrument definitions (e.g. Pms1d, Irs, etc), typically when
more than on of a given instrument is allowed and you need to differentiate
with probe location, will require modifying the set_var_name() function in
the same file.  Don't forget 'make install'.
<p>
<b>nimbus</b>, <b>xbuild</b>, and <b>xhd</b> all use the hdr_api.
</ul>
<p>

<b>libraf++/hdrAPI</b>
<ul>
For C++ programs there is a C++ class analogous to hdr_api.  At this time
(Mar 2000) <b>rtplot</b> and <b>xpms2d</b> are the only programs using hdrAPI.
For struct Blk instruments no modifications should be necessary.
</ul>
<p>

<b>xbuild</b>
<ul>
xbuild uses the hdr_api to read in an existing header, but generates new
headers internally (i.e. hdr_api has no "set" ability, just "get").
<p>
<li><b>configure.c</b> is used to create GUI buttons.  For this example
replicate the 5 lines of code for "DPRES", and increment the
'NumOtherBlockItems' count.

If the instrument has multiple locations look at the Pms1 code.
<p>
<li><b>otherblockwidgets.c</b> is the code for filling in the header structures
(i.e. struct Blk, Pms1, Irs, Evt, etc) before writing the header to disk.  Make
sure you have appropriate byte swapping (htonl()/htons())!  Replicate the "DPRES" example of about 20 lines of code.  If you are adding a Pms probe or a
navigation probe, you may wnat to add it to a different source file (e.g.
<b>navwidgets.c</b>, <b>pmswidgets.c</b>, etc).
</ul>
<p>

<b>nimbus</b>
<ul>
<li><b>include</b>
<ul>
Edit <b>amlib.fns</b> (DO NOT IGNORE THE WARNING ABOUT TABS), and add lines
for new variables.  If it's a raw variable to decoded from the recorded data,
then add <b>xlate</b> function names (typically start with xl) in the third
column, if you are adding derived (you may be adding both) names, then add
functions to the fourth column.  If you need a "initialization" function for
the instrument (e.g. to read constants from the <b>Defaults</b> file), then
add a function into the second column.
</ul>
<p>

<li><b>src/amlib/xlate</b>
<ul>
This directory is for functions which decode raw data from the recorded data
records.  Functions are called once for each data record (each data record
contains one seconds worth of data).  Add a new file with appropriate function
for decoding data (e.g. last function in psfd.c has Dpres).
</ul>
<p>

<li><b>src/amlib/std</b>
<ul>
If you desire derived variables, then add functions in this directory.  Similar
principal as xlate directory functions are called once per output sample (once
per record for low rate data, 25 times for high rate data).  You'll need to
add an entry into the <b>DerivedNames</b> and <b>DependTable</b>.
<p>

<li><b>src/filter</b>
<ul>
Edit <b>hdr_decode.c</b>, which cycles through the header via the hdr_api, and
decodes each struct in the header.  (e.g. DPRES_STR).
</ul>
<p>

</ul>
