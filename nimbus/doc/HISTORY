02/11/96	2.3.0
	Fixed bug in SumCounter (was truncating), bug only affected Counters
	with calcos.  When nimbus asked for flight number, it then failed to
	record it in netCDF file.  ACE variable XFCN added. GIV.  Filled data
	gaps had time stamp of -32767:-32767:-32767, fixed.  Added 'Edit'

	differntial variable added.  Mod PCAS code to use FLOW for Sample
	Volume.
