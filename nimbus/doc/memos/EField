Here are the variable names for the SailPlane Electric Mill Field thingy.

Raw SDI Variables:

	SPROLL	Roll

	SPVNT	Nose Top
	SPVNB	Nose Bottom
	SPVNS	Nose Starboard
	SPVNP	Nose Port

	SPVFT	Fueselage Top
	SPVFB	Fueselage Bottom
	SPVFS	Fueselage Starboard
	SPVFP	Fueselage Port

	SPVYO
	SPVZO

	SPSFP	Sign bits for Fueselage Mills.
	SPSFS
	SPSFT
	SPSFB
	
	ZRANGE
	YRANGE

These last 6 variables are all in a flag word called DIG3.

Corresponding calibrated derived Variables:

	SPENT	Nose Top
	SPENB	Nose Bottom
	SPENS	Nose Starboard
	SPENP	Nose Port

	SPEFT	Fueselage Top
	SPEFB	Fueselage Bottom
	SPEFS	Fueselage Starboard
	SPEFP	Fueselage Port

	SPEYO
	SPEZO


I was hoping to avoid the SP prefix, but VNS and VNSC are already used.
Here are the rest of the derived variables:

	SPEXZ
	SPEXY

	SPEFZ
	SPEFY
	SPEFQZ
	SPEFQY

	SPENZ
	SPENY
	SPENQZ
	SPENQY

Are the final output variables.
