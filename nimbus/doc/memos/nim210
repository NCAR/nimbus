Nimbus 2.1.0 has been released.  Features/bugs include:

- I've added a sub-menu to the edit menu called 'Toggle Probe'.  This allows
  you turn on/off whole probes at once, without having to locate and select
  each variable.  However it has a bug in it;  If you select a PMS1D probe, it
  does all of 1D probes, not just the one you selected.

- PCORS for C130 ready for prime time.

- XSO2 variables and code added to AMLIB.


Transparent changes:

- New 250hz decimating filters.  Speeded up by 30% while maintaining old specs.

- Logic in Filtering to not filter varaibles that are not required.

- convertOffset computations for autocalibration added.
