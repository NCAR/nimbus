.SH NAME
crayweof  - Write a Cray EOF (End Of File) mark to a Cray-Blocked file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
INTEGER CRAYWEOF
.br
\fIier\fR = CRAYWEOF(\fIifc\fR)
.br
INTEGER  \fIifc\fR
.SH "C EXTENSION"
ier = crayweof(ifc)
.br
int    *ifc;
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B CRAYWEOF
routine writes a Cray EOF (End Of File) mark to a Cray-Blocked file. This
routine is part of a family of routines which allow you to read and
write Cray files from compute servers other than Cray machines.
.PP
It is not necessary for you call this
routine unless you specifically want to create a Cray multi-file
dataset.  The 
.B CRAYCLOSE
routine will automatically add a Cray EOF mark when closing the file.
.PP
If this routine is called on a Cray unblocked file, the routine
immediately returns with an error.  There are no EOF marks in a Cray
unblocked file.
.PP
This routine has one argument:
.TP 5
.I ifc
The integer return from a previously issed crayopen(3).
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
To access this routine, you must include the following loader flags when
building your program:
.sp
.ce
-L /usr/local/lib -lncaru
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.B CRAYWEOF
returns a non-negative integer upon success,
otherwise -1 is returned to indicate an error of some kind.
