     INTRODUCTION

          The BTIDriver RPC libraries are the Remote Procedure
          Call libraries that work with Ballard Technology's
          universal driver API.  The RPC libraries will operate
          remotely controlled devices such as the OmniBusBox device.
          The folders listed above contain the various protocols
          supported by the BTIDriver RPC Libraries.  In the folder
          for each protocol are several example programs.  See
          the README in each folder for a full description of
          these example programs.

          For multi-protocol BTIDriver devices, simply
          combine the concepts from the included example
          programs to build your own custom application.



     CORRECTIONS, WARNINGS, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
